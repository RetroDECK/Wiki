## ⚠️ Important: Ponzu does not work with RetroDECK 0.10.0b ⚠️

The new layered flatpak system and Ponzu’s temporary solution for installing legacy emulators cannot operate within this new architecture.

We’re shipping two components that cover the most common use-cases previously handled by Ponzu:

Azahar and Ryubing.

**What you can do:**

- Keep your existing RetroDECK installation if you rely on Ponzu.
- Avoid upgrading to 0.10.0b until you’re ready to move away from Ponzu
- You can always downgrade via Flathub if you need the older version, but this is **Not Recommended!**

### Core Architecture

<img src="../../../wiki_icons/retrodeck/icon-framework.svg" width="75">


- **Rebuilt component interactions** Completely rebuilt how all components interact within RetroDECK and RetroDECK itself. 
- **Introduced a modular component system**, with each component isolated in its own sub-sandbox.
- **Upgraded to `org.kde.Platform 6.10`** removing previous passive-aggressive terminal errors.
- **Refactored the `net.retrodeck.retrodeck.yml` configuration file** for improved structure, easier maintenance and made it very pretty.
- **Added granular, purpose-driven permission descriptions** with explicit rationales for each in the `net.retrodeck.retrodeck.yml` (yay transparency!).

---

### RetroDECK Assembler 

<img src="../../../wiki_icons/retrodeck/icon-assembler.svg" width="75">

- **Complete build pipeline overhaul:** Each component is now built independently, and the resulting artifacts are then assembled into the final RetroDECK system.
- **Reduced total application size:** Through library decoupling and the removal of obsolete files, the overall application footprint was reduced by **800 MB**, despite the inclusion of new components.

---

### RetroDECK Alchemist & The Component System

<img src="../../../wiki_icons/retrodeck/icon-alchemist.svg" width="75"> 

- **Introduced the RetroDECK Alchemist** to the build pipeline. Each component is now defined and sourced via a `component_recipe` file managed by the RetroDECK Alchemist.
- **Added component ingredient files** that instruct the RetroDECK Framework on the details and requirements of each component.
- **Redesigned library and dependency management**, ensuring that each component retrieves only the resources it requires.
- **In simple terms:** RetroDECK now provides a streamlined and standardized method for integrating most application formats, including Flatpak, AppImage, standalone binaries, and source-built applications. Provided the required component files are available, thus simplifying and expanding the process of adding or updating applications. We are also investigating future support for additional architectures such as AARCH64 (Linux ARM) via this modular system. **Note:** the RetroDECK team retains final authority over the approval and inclusion of all components.

### RetroDECK API

<img src="../../../wiki_icons/retrodeck/icon-api.svg" width="75">

We’ve introduced a brand-new RetroDECK API. It powers several core internal functions today, and it’s fully open for external developers to play with.

**Questions / Comments:**

**Mr.ImCoKeMaN:** 

Gee willikers! 
RetroDECK Team, this is a mighty fine system! Now I can finally do my taxes on Home Finance (1983), the premier platform for fiscal responsibility!

**RetroDECK Team:**

We’re glad to hear that you’re enjoying it. And thank you for contributing so many x86-64 ports to PortMaster.

---


### Added: A new Emulator: Azahar

<img src="../../../wiki_images/logos/azahar-logo.svg" width="75">

Azahar is a lightweight, high-performance emulator for Nintendo 3DS (N3DS) titles.

It will also serve as the new default emulator for N3DS.

**Read more:**

[Azahar: Guide](../../wiki_emulator_guides/azahar/azahar-guide.md)

**Questions / Comments:**

**Mrs. A. User:** 

Gosh darn! 
RetroDECK Team, will you move the data during the upgrade? From those old-timey legacy Citra-Standalone-via-Ponzu folders?

**RetroDECK Team:**

All data from the Citra-Standalone (via Ponzu) will be migrated. The RetroArch Citra Core data will remain unchanged, as users will still have the option to use it. 
Nothing will affect the RetroArch data.

However, please note that save states **are not** compatible between the old Citra-Standalone (via Ponzu) and Azahar. 
We strongly recommend using in-game saves only, as we do for all systems.

The current default Citra RetroArch Core will remain available for those who prefer it. 
The new default, however, will be Azahar. To switch back to the Citra core, 
you will need to select it under Alternative Emulators in ES-DE. 

Additionally, Azahar does not support the **.3ds** format (read more on the wiki link above).

### Added: A new Emulator: Ryubing

<img src="../../../wiki_images/logos/ryubing-logo.png" width="85">

Ryubing replaces Ryujinx (Legacy).

**Read more:**

[Ryubing: Guide](../../wiki_emulator_guides/ryubing/ryubing-guide.md)

**Questions / Comments:**

**Mr. A. User:** 

Jumpin’ Jehoshaphat! 
RetroDECK Team, will you move the data from legacy Ryujinx during the upgrade?

**RetroDECK Team:**

The data structure remains largely the same. Your existing folders should be automatically migrated.
However, a firmware reinstallation will still be required. Make sure you perform in-game saves beforehand.


---


### Added: A new Engine: OpenBor


<img src="../../../wiki_images/logos/openbor-logo.svg" width="75">

OpenBOR (Open Beats of Rage) is a flexible 2-D fighting-game engine. 

It comes it's own RetroDECK wrapper that handles: `.bor` and `.openbor` files for easier adding of games into RetroDECK (kinda like we are doing with GZDoom).

**Read more:**

[OpenBOR: Guide](../../wiki_engine_guides/openbor/openbor-guide.md)


---


### Added: A new System: Flips

<img src="../../../wiki_images/logos/flips-logo.png" width="75">

**Flips** (Floating IPS) is a lightweight, patcher that supports both `.ips` and `.bps` formats, allowing users to apply and create ROM hack patches.

You will find Flips inside the RetroDECK Configurator as its own component.

## New Features

### Added: Folder Iconset Support & Lahrs Folder Iconset

<img src="../../../wiki_icons/folder-iconsets/lahrs-main/rd_home.ico" width="75">

Introducing our first-ever Folder Iconset, designed by RetroDECK team member **Lahrs**.

This update also includes handy tools to re-add or remove the iconset (perfect for those who like to keep things minimal and are allergic to icons).

Plus, we've laid the groundwork for easy future iconset swaps, so the community can contribute new designs down the line.
 

---

### Added: Storage directory

<img src="../../../wiki_icons/folder-iconsets/lahrs-main/storage.ico" width="75">

A new `retrodeck/storage` directory has been added as a centralized location for miscellaneous data, making it easier for users to access and manage.

Some data is already exposed, with additional content planned to be migrated from internal Flatpak locations in future updates based on community feedback.

**What type of Data are you thinking about?**

- DLC / Patches 
- Downloaded Game Data
- Future DOS emulator - environments for installed: Windows 3.1, 95, 98.
- Assets - quick access to things like FM banks, soundfonts (for U​ZDoom) and DAT files, GameOver screens etc.. (for MAME).
- Other

---

### Added: Videos directory

<img src="../../../wiki_icons/folder-iconsets/lahrs-main/videos.ico" width="75">

A new `retrodeck/videos` directory was added to store video recordings generated by supported components. 

This prevents video files from being mixed with screenshots in `retrodeck/screenshots`  (it was kinda stupid).

---

## RetroDECK Framework

<img src="../../../wiki_icons/retrodeck/icon-framework.svg" width="75">

**Changes:**

- **Dialogs:** Fully rewritten all pop-up dialogs for greater clarity and usability.
- **First Install:** Merged the *Add to Steam* and *Add Controller Templates* prompts, since one is unnecessary without the other.

 
**Added:** 

- **First Install:** Improved retrodeck data folder location options that adapt to the device type RetroDECK is being installed on.
- **First Install:** Introduced a new prompt to enable **Steam Sync** during setup.
- **Steam Sync:** Added Steam Flatpak Version support.
- **Iconset Swaps:** Added a framework for future iconset swaps if the community contributes new sets. 

---

## RetroDECK Configurator

<img src="../../../wiki_icons/retrodeck/icon-configurator.svg" width="75">


**Changes:**

- Overhauled and refined nearly all configurator dialogs to provide a smoother user experience.

**Added:** 

- New tool to **remove** or **re-add** the iconsset via the configurator.
- BIOS Checker comes with additional BIOS/Firmware entries and clearer descriptions.

**Note:**

Our long-term plan remains to develop a **Godot version of the Configurator**. The new API introduced in this update is a foundational step toward that goal.

---

### GZDoom

<img src="../../../wiki_images/logos/gzdoom-logo.png" width="75">

**Note:** 

The RetroDECK team had planned to update to **UZDoom**. However, the UZDoom team is still in the process of integrating their own Flatpak into their build pipeline. We have offered our assistance to them if needed.

For this update, we will continue using **GZDoom**.

HARM1.WAD # Harmony
ROTWB.WAD # Rise Of The Wool Ball
SQUARE1.PK3 # The Adventures of Square
```

The wrapper now provides full support for all files listed here and more:

- [DOOMWiki: IWAD](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/IWAD)

**TIP - NEW GUIDE: Running DOOM 64 CE in RetroDECK**

With the addition of **Flips** and the newly exposed FM bank and SoundFont directories in `retrodeck/storage/gzdoom/audio/`, the complete DOOM 64 CE setup process can now be performed mostly within RetroDECK, making it much easier for users to try this excellent mod.

### Questions / Comments: RetroDECK Team

**Why call the update Dastardly Dansband?**

Dansband is a Scandinavian dance music genre blending pop, schlager, country, rock, and folk influences, with catchy melodies and romantic lyrics made for partner dancing.

This update felt exactly like that: a chaotic, emotionally charged dance where everyone had to stay in step just to survive or face extinction.

Without the rewrite, the old method simply wouldn’t have worked anymore.

A dance with death, one that would either end the project or see it reborn like a phoenix.

The name is also an homage to The Seventh Seal (1957) by Ingmar Bergman, where the knight Antonius Block plays a chess match with Death itself.

And finally, Dastardly tips its hat to Dick Dastardly from the Hanna-Barbera cartoons. Keeping things lighthearted, even as it marks a truly dastardly challenging update.

---

**Last words?**

We would like to thank the community for their patience while we built this completely revamped RetroDECK.

The best part? You'll hardly notice the changes!

Under the hood, however, we've created something truly unique.
