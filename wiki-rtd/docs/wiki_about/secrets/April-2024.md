Highlights:

- Bonsai Banana Released
- PortMaster

<!-- more -->

## Bonsai Banana - Released

We thank everyone for your patience

## PortMaster ❤️ RetroDECK

We are proud to announce that the parts of the RetroDECK Team, Batocera Team and PortMaster Team is going bring [PortMaster](https://portmaster.games/index.html) to x86_64 systems.

Four ourself the goal is to have it ship natively in RetroDECK... and guess what?!

It already works in our early POC!

Not all ports have x86_64 versions but more will be added over time and a lot of work left to do.

### What is PortMaster?

It is a Linux Port Manager to easy download, manage, create and play various Linux game ports.
In many of the ports you will need to own game and take files from the original game for the ports to work.

For a full gamelist check here:

### There exists other ways to run the same games

Yes, there exists many ways to run these ports and games outside of PortMaster.

PortMaster was born from the handeld gaming devices as a way to play these games on something like the Miyoo Mini.

So for certain ports it might make more sense to install them directly via other options like:

- [Luxtorpeda](https://github.com/dreamer/luxtorpeda)
- [Lutris](https://lutris.net/)
- [Flathub](https://flathub.org/en)
- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/)
- [Heroic](https://heroicgameslauncher.com/)
- [MiniGalaxy](https://sharkwouter.github.io/minigalaxy/)

All we are doing is proving you with a new option for doing so with PortMaster within RetroDECK.

## That is all for April

Thanks everyone!
