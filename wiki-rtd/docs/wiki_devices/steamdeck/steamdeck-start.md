**NOTE:** 

Depending on what language you have set in `Desktop Mode`, things might be named differently.

## Read This: About SD Cards

If you plan to use RetroDECK on your SD Card, know that SD cards can be a bit tricky.

### Always Format the Card & Name it Properly

- **Format the Card**: Always format the a new card when you get it: Press `Steam` -> `Storage` -> `Select the Card` -> Press `Y` for Options ->`Format Drive`.
- **Stick to Alphanumeric Characters**: It's best to stick to alphanumeric characters (a-Z, 0-9) and avoid using special characters, emojis, or spaces in the card's name.

#### Why Avoid Special Characters in SD Card Naming on Linux?

Using special characters in SD card naming on Linux can lead to various issues. Here are some reasons why it's not advisable:

- **Command-line complications**: Special characters like spaces, ampersands, and exclamation marks can cause problems when used in command-line operations. They often need to be escaped or quoted, which can be cumbersome and error-prone.
- **Script and program errors**: Many scripts and programs may not handle special characters well, leading to unexpected behavior or errors. This is especially true for older or poorly written software.
- **Network protocols**: Some network protocols require special care when dealing with filenames containing spaces or special characters. This can lead to issues when transferring files over a network.

### Tips on Buying an SD Card

We have seen some users having issues because they have bought scam cards, here are some tips:

- **Buy from a reputable brand and store**: Stick to well-known brands like SanDisk, Samsung, or Kingston, and purchase from authorized retailers.
- **Check the packaging**: Authentic SD cards usually come in professional-grade packaging. Look for clear branding, holograms, and security seals.
- **Inspect the card design**: Genuine SD cards have consistent styling, clear text, and smooth connectors. Be wary of cards with blurry text or rough edges.
- **Verify the price**: If the price seems too good to be true, it probably is. Research the average price for the specific SD card model youâ€™re interested in.
- **Test the card**: Use capacity testing tools like H2testw or F3 to verify the cardâ€™s storage capacity and performance.
- **Check reviews**: Look for current reviews online to ensure the card has good read and write speeds.
- **Avoid third-party sellers**: Purchase directly from the manufacturer or authorized dealers to reduce the risk of buying counterfeit products.
- **Research vendors**: Ensure you are purchasing from reputable sellers and verify their performance.
