## ⚠️ Important: Ponzu does not work with RetroDECK 0.10.0b ⚠️

The new layered flatpak system and Ponzu’s temporary solution for installing legacy emulators cannot operate within this new architecture.

We’re shipping two components that cover the most common use‑cases previously handled by Ponzu:
Azahar and Ryubing.

**What you can do:**

- Keep your existing RetroDECK installation if you rely on Ponzu.

- Avoid upgrading to 0.10.0b until you’re ready to move away from Ponzu, or downgrade via Flathub if you need the older version temporarily.

## Rewrote Everything from the Ground Up

### Core Architecture

<img src="../../../wiki_icons/retrodeck/icon-framework.svg" width="75">


- Completely rebuilt how all components interact within RetroDECK and RetroDECK itself. 
- Made a modular component system where each component is isolated in it's own sub‑sandbox.
- Upgraded to org.kde.platform 6.10.
- Refactored the `net.retrodeck.retrodeck.yml` configuration file for clearer structure, easier maintenance and made it oh so pretty.
- Significantly reduced the default permissions granted to the RetroDECK application.
- Added granular, purpose‑driven permission sets with explicit rationales for each in the `net.retrodeck.retrodeck.yml`.

---

### RetroDECK Assembler 

<img src="../../../wiki_icons/retrodeck/icon-assembler.svg" width="75">

- Overhauled the entire build pipeline. 
- Each component is built separately and the finished artifact pieces from each component is put together into RetroDECK proper.  

---

### RetroDECK Alchemist & The Component System

<img src="../../../wiki_icons/retrodeck/icon-alchemist.svg" width="75"> 

- Introduced the RetroDECK Alchemist to the Build Pipeline; Each component is defined and sourced via a component_recipe file by the RetroDECK Alchemist.
- Various component ingredient files that tells the RetroDECK Framework how and what the component is.
- Redesigned library and dependency handling, ensuring each component pulls only what it needs.

---

### RetroDECK API

<img src="../../../wiki_icons/retrodeck/icon-api.svg" width="75">

We’ve introduced a brand‑new RetroDECK API. It powers several core internal functions today, and it’s fully open for external developers to play with. 

---


## New Components

We added some new goodies.

### Added: A new Emulator: XRoar

<img src="../../../wiki_images/logos/xroar-tano64-logo.jpg" width="150">

XRoar is an open‑source emulator that recreates the classic 8‑bit Tandy/Dragon computers. 

<img src="../xroar-balldozer.png" width="250">

It supports tape, disk, and cartridge images, providing a faithful recreation of the original hardware and its peripherals.

- Tandy Color Computer (CoCo) 
- Dragon Data Dragon 32 / 64
- Tano Dragon

### Added: A new Emulator: Azahar

<img src="../../../wiki_images/logos/azahar-logo.svg" width="75">

Azahar is a lightweight, high‑performance emulator for N3DS games.

---


### Added: A new Emulator: Ryubing

<img src="../../../wiki_images/logos/ryubing-logo.png" width="85">

Ryubing replaces Ryujinx (Legacy).



---


### Added: A new Engine: OpenBor


<img src="../../../wiki_images/logos/openbor-logo.svg" width="75">

OpenBOR (Open Beats of Rage) is a flexible 2‑D fighting‑game engine. 

It comes it's own RetroDECK wrapper that handles: `.bor` and `.openbor` files for easier adding of games into RetroDECK (kinda like we are doing with GZDoom).


---


### Added: A new System/Tool: Flips

<img src="../../../wiki_images/logos/flips-logo.png" width="75">


**Flips** (Floating IPS) is a lightweight, cross‑platform patcher that supports both **IPS** and **BPS** patch formats for ROMHacks. 

It allows users to apply, create, and verify patches for ROMs and other binary files.

You can open the Flips interface from the Configurator.

## New Features


### Added: Lahrs Folder Icons & Iconsets

New folder icons created by RetroDECK team member **Lahrs**. 

<img src="../../../wiki_icons/folder-iconsets/lahrs-main/rd_home.ico" width="75">

---


### Added: Storage directory

A new `retrodeck/storage` directory serves as a catch‑all location for miscellaneous data we want to expose to users in a more accessible way.  

Only a few items are exposed currently, but we plan to migrate additional data from internal Flatpak locations in upcoming updates.  

**What type of Data are you thinking about?**

- DLC / Patches 
- None Saves HDD Space
- Download Game Data
- Future DOS emulator – environments for installed: Windows 3.1, 95, 98.
- Assets – quick access to things like FM banks, soundfonts (for U​ZDoom) and DAT files, GameOver screens etc.. (for MAME).  
- Other

**Changes:**

- **Dialogs:** Fully rewritten all pop-up dialogs for greater clarity and usability.

- **First Install:** Introduced a new prompt to enable **Steam Sync** during setup.

---

<img src="../../../wiki_icons/retrodeck/icon-configurator.svg" width="75">


**Changes:**

- **Dialogs:** Overhauled and refined nearly all configurator dialogs for a smoother user experience.

**Added:**

## Components: Emulators / Engines / Systems / Ports / Clients

<img src="../../../wiki_icons/retrodeck/icon-component.svg" width="75">

All components have been updated to a up to date version:

- All Emulators
- All Multi-Emulators (Retroarch & Cores, MAME, Etc..)
- All Engines 
- All Systems

**The following are the highlighted changes that go beyond a regular update:**

--- 

### ES-DE

<img src="../../../wiki_images/logos/es-de-logo.png" width="75">

We only list the RetroDECK specific changes here, check the full: [ES-DE: Changelog](https://gitlab.com/es-de/emulationstation-de/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

**Changes:** 

- Several folders have been hidden because they aren't supported in RetroDECK (e.g., `Lutris`, `Epic`, `Windows`, and others) to avoid confusion.  
- The `Desktop` folder remains available for various community tinkering experiments.

**Added:** 

- In `es_find_rules.xml`, the `<emulator name="FLATPAKSPAWN">` has been added, making it easier for users who want to tinker with RetroDECK and break out of the sandbox.
- The RetroDECK Theme has been updated with all the new features of ES-DE 3.4.0 such as Played Time.

**Fixed:** 

- A number of alternative emulators that were mistakenly displayed, though unavailable in RetroDECK have now been hidden.

**Known Issue:** 

- The **ES‑DE Configurations** submenu in RetroDECK's ES‑DE does not yet support translations. Translation support is planned for a future release.
- The **ES‑DE: Game Importer** function (e.g., importing Steam games and such) does not work with RetroDECK and has been disabled.

### GZDoom:

<img src="../../../wiki_images/logos/gzdoom-logo.png" width="75">

We had plans to update to UZDoom but the UZDoom Team is still working making their own flatpak as part of their build pipeline. 

**Added:**

**Enhanced .doom file support**

  - Allows spaces in sourced WAD names.  
  - Enables mod‑specific `.ini` files.  
  - Supports symbolic‑linked files.

**New IWADs in the RetroDECK wrapper list**
  
  - `delaweare.wad`
