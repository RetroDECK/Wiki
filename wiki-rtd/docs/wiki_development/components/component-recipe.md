# recipe.sh

The **Component Recipe File**  `recipe.sh` purpose is to tell the RetroDECK build automation system what needs to happen to take the components base source from: **AppImage**, **Flatpak**, **Precompiled Binary** or **Built from Source** and turn it into a RetroDECK Component.

The recipe file is **NOT** included in the final component package.
