**Release Date:** 2022-07-07

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

At the moment the emulator configs are reset during every update, this was made because every version may bring new configurations, please back them up if you did some manual configs.

**Emulators:**
            
- Updated all the emulators at the latest available version..
            
**Backend**:
            
- Manifest general code cleanup.
            
**Known Issues:**
            
- PCSX2: due to its limitation, the standalone PCSX2 doesn't have any way to set the hotkeys, so no save and load state, no quit button. In order to quit press: STEAM -> CLOSE WINDOW, be aware that the state is not automatically saved.
- External controllers and keyboard seems not to be working, expecially in the desktop mode.
