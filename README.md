## Do you want to help to contribute to the wiki?

Join the Discord and post in `ðŸ’™-i-want-to-help` channel that you want to help out with the wiki.

You will then get access to the `ðŸ–‹-wiki-maintainers`channel by one of the mods and you can discuss with your fellow contributors in that channel.

## How to submit articles?

You need to have git, gh and python installed.

1. Clone the wiki repo.
2. Install `pip install mkdocs-material` & `pip install mkdocs-rss-plugin` & `pip install mkdocs-video`
3. Navigate to the `/wiki-rtd/` directory where the `mkdocs.yml` is located.
4. Type in cli `mkdocs serve` to start the local webserver.
5. Browse to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` and you will have a local instance of the wiki running.
6. Submit and commit new wiki .md articles under the docs/ structure and wait for a wikimaintaners review to merge the commit.
7. Talk to `ðŸ–‹-wiki-maintainers` before creating new subfolders under /docs
