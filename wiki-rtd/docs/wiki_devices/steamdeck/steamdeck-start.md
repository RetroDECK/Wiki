### SDCard Tips

If you plan to use RetroDECK on your SD Card know that SD cards can be tricky and there are many scam cards out there. 

Follow these tips when buying a new SD card:

- Buy from a reputable brand and store.
- Ensure the card has good read and write speeds (check current reviews online).
- Format the card when you get it: Press `Steam` - `Storage` - `Select the Card` - Press `Y` for Options - `Format Drive`.
- Avoid using special characters, emojis, or spaces in the card's name. Stick to A-Z and 1-9.
- There are online solutions to test if an SD card is fake, like the software `f3` for Linux.
