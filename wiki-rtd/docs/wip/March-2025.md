## 0.9.1b Released!

<img src="../../../logo_stacked_merged.svg" width="400"> 

The huge bugfix and quality-of-life changes patch, version 0.9.1b, has been released.

We are still working on improvements based on feedback for version 0.9.2b. 

Additionally, we are in the early planning stages for the next major update, 0.10.0b.

## Repair-Paths Tool

We are currently experimenting with a new Configurator Tool: **Repair-Paths Tool**. 

This tool, available in both GUI and CLI, checks if all folders exist as defined in *retrodeck.cfg*. 

- If any folders are missing, it searches common locations like internal and SD card install locations. 
- If the folders are still not found, it allows users to manually locate them. 

This feature is particularly useful for users who have moved their folders manually or switched SD cards, as it helps update the paths without affecting user settings. 

Essentially, it runs the same process as the Configurator, rebuilding symlinks after the new locations are defined.

## Experiment ⚗️ on the Wiki

We have added an **Experiments** ⚗️ section to the wiki. This section showcases creative projects made by users that are a bit out of scope and not supported within the standard RetroDECK experience. We try to provide guides or showcase these projects to help and inspire others who likes to tinker.

### The first experiment - Launching Desktop Apps with RetroDECK

If you break the RetroDECK sandbox the user **murkl** has provided instructions on: 

How-to use the `retrodeck/roms/windows/` folder to launch full Desktop Apps via RetroDECK.

**murkl** together with the RetroDECK Team expanded it to a full guide:
