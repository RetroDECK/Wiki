## RetroDECK 0.9.1b was Released

<img src="../../../icon-rd.svg" width="75"> 

The huge bugfix and quality-of-life changes patch, version 0.9.1b, has been released.

We are still working on improvements based on feedback for version 0.9.2b. 

Additionally, we are in the early planning stages for the next major update, 0.10.0b.

## Repair-Paths Tool


<img src="../../../icon-configurator.svg" width="75"> 

We are currently experimenting with a new Configurator Tool: **Repair-Paths Tool**. 

This tool, available in both GUI and CLI, checks if all folders exist as defined in *retrodeck.cfg*. 

- If any folders are missing, it searches common locations like internal and SD card install locations. 
- If the folders are still not found, it allows users to manually locate them. 

This feature is particularly useful for users who have moved their folders manually or switched SD cards, as it helps update the paths without affecting user settings. 

Essentially, it runs the same process as the Configurator, rebuilding symlinks after the new locations are defined.

## Experiments ‚öóÔ∏è on the Wiki

We have added an **Experiments** ‚öóÔ∏è section to the wiki. This section showcases creative projects made by users that are a bit out of scope and not supported within the standard RetroDECK experience. We try to provide guides or showcase these projects to help and inspire others who likes to tinker.

### murkl's experiment - Launching Desktop Apps with RetroDECK

Community member **murkl** showcased that if you break the RetroDECK sandbox, you can use the `retrodeck/roms/windows/` folder to launch full Desktop Apps via RetroDECK.

**murkl** together with the RetroDECK Team wrote a guide:

## Lahrs Folder Icon Packs

Community member **Lahrs** is working on RetroDECK folder icon packs in various different styles.

The goal is to have a nice icon on most of the folders shipped within RetroDECK.

**Frames:**

**Themes:**

<img src="../../../lahrs2.webp" width="400"> 


These are still very early in the making, but us in the RetroDECK Team think they are really neat! 

When the packs are finished we will probably create an Configurator Tool make the installation these optional packs a breeze.

## That is all for now 

There are more things we are working on, but you will see them in future blog updates!
