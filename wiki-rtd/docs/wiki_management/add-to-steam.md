<img src="../../wiki_icons/pixelitos/steam.png" width="75">

There are several ways to add RetroDECK to Steam. If you have the Flatpak version of Steam installed, you need to do some extra steps for everything to work.

## Built-in: RetroDECK to Steam

Since version 0.9.1b RetroDECK has an option to add it to Steam with art via the Configurator or during first setup.

## Steam Flatpak Version

If you have the [Steam Flatpak](https://flathub.org/apps/com.valvesoftware.Steam) version installed, some extra steps apply.

**Warning:** 

This opens up the Flatpak more than usual, as flatpaks are not allowed to run many system commands from the sandbox.

### Add the Permission

To make a flatpak launch other flatpaks, it needs a special permission called `org.freedesktop.Flatpak`. 

You can add the permission using Flatseal or directly from the terminal.

**Flatseal:**

1. Open [Flatseal](https://flathub.org/apps/com.github.tchx84.Flatseal) (install it from Flathub if you don't have it).
2. Click on Steam.
3. Scroll down to `Session Bus` and press the `+` sign.
4. Paste in `org.freedesktop.Flatpak`.
5. Launch Steam.

**Terminal:**

Open and copy the following into the terminal:

`flatpak --user override --talk-name=org.freedesktop.Flatpak com.valvesoftware.Steam`

### Add RetroDECK to Steam Flatpak

Add RetroDECK to Steam by via a method following the guides above. 

**Note on manual install:** 

Steam won't find the application directly, so you will need to manually browse to the desktop file to add it:

`/var/lib/flatpak/app/net.retrodeck.retrodeck/current/active/export/share/applications/`

### Configuring RetroDECK in Steam Flatpak

After adding RetroDECK to Steam, right-click on the RetroDECK entry and change the shortcut values to:

**Target:**

`/usr/bin/flatpak-spawn`

**Launch options:**

`--host flatpak run --branch=stable --arch=x86_64 net.retrodeck.retrodeck`

This should now be enough for you to launch RetroDECK.
