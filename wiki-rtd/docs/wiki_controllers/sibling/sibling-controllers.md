# Sibling Controllers

Sibling Controllers is a broad category that encompasses the some parts of the third party controller space. <br>
They are often controllers that are unconformable to hold, break easy or just look weird.<br>
So you hand them over to your sibling or friend to make sure you win all the games.

## PlayStation 2

The PS2 had a vast selection of sibling controllers

### MadCatz PS2

Famous for being the mold example of what a sibling controller is. Breaks easily, is extremely unconformable and will increase your chances of winning by 50%.

### NYKO iType 2

This is a trap style controller to stop your sibling from ruining all the important buttons on other controllers. As your sibling likes to press all the buttons all the time, this is the perfect options as there is so many options to press so he/she can't break them all?... Right?!

### Nyko Airflow 2

This is the perfect controller for that friend that just can't stop talking when you play. The extremely loud fan will dampen out any vocal annoyances and allow you to concentrate on winning Tekken Tag Tournament.

### HyperMax 3

This is the controller for the one person that everyone in the friend group hated except for your best friend. Because this person was his/her friend and a major annoyance to your perfect friendship dynamic. When you told your mom you did not want to invite him/her you got sternly yelled at and  you need to invite everyone to play even the toxic people. So as petty revenge you gave Brad?? this controller... good luck... Brad!


### Samurai PS2

One of your friends is extremely good at games and no matter what controller you throw at him/her...you loose. So you gave him/her the most unconformable controller you could find... the Samurai. If that friend still won you moved on to the one of your ultimate weapons.

### Resident Evil 4 - Chainsaw

So you just lost to your friend again on using the Samurai PS2 controller, this time you will not loose... you gave him/her this the scion of ultimate uncomfortablility for the PS2. The Resident Evil 4 Chainsaw controller:

- It is big
- It is bulky
- It is unwieldy

This time you will win for sure!

## Super Nintendo

### Ascii Pad SNES

The Ascii Pad SNES is a bit unconformable but your sibling that was struggling in CO-OP games for the SNES needed a bit of a turbo boost... you would never use the this kind of turbo controller against your sibling right? To spam in Street Fighter 2??? RIGHT?!

## Xbox

### Gamemaster FPS
