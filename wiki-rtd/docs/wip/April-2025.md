## NEW - AI Powered Game Play Assist and Voice Simulation  

Many of our users are looking to the past to escape the harsh realities of the modern world. 

But they are missing one key aspect of the retro experience truly authentic. 

We are proud to introduce the next big feature of RetroDECK:

**AI Powered Game Play Assist and Voice Simulation** 

Connect RetroDECK to your favorite local or generative AI and have several character profiles to choose from that will talk to you, help and comment your on gameplay.

### Character Profiles

#### World of Warcraft - Raid Leader

The Raid Leader will do quick comments and remarks that you can only get better no matter what to do. 

**When you are playing:** He will constantly remind you that you are playing at i below-shit-tier level and each time you do the slightest misstep he will go into rage mode and reduce your DKP. 

#### World of Warcraft - Drunk Hunter

## That is all for now 

There are more things we are working on, but you will see them in future blog updates!

And as always if you want to help with development join the üíô-i-want-to-help channel on Discord.

Thanks everyone!
