**Release Date:** 2022-07-01

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

At the moment the emulator configs are reset during every update, this was made because every version may bring new configurations, please back them up if you did some manual configs.

**Emulators:**
            
- Updated all the emulators at the latest available version.
- DOLPHIN (SA): Fixed a bug where Dolphin couldn't be properly configured. If it's still misconfigured please run `flatpak run net.retrodeck.retrodeck --reset-sa` in order to reset all the standalone emulators, including Dolphin.
- CITRA (SA): Reconfigured controls and hotkeys.
- MELONDS (SA): Reconfigured controls.
- GAMBATTE (LIBRETRO): Added GB colorization.
- RETROARCH (LIBRETRO): Tweaked some configs and fixed some overlapping hotkeys (FPS was same as Show Menu action).
            
**Backend**:
            
- Removed some broken tools that will be reintroduced once fixed, including the roms moving tool.
- Updated ES-DE configs (es_find_rules, es_settings, es_systems).
- Manifest trimmend and general code cleanup.
            
**Known Issues:**
            
- PCSX2: due to its limitation, the standalone PCSX2 doesn't have any way to set the hotkeys, so no save and load state, no quit button. In order to quit press: STEAM -> CLOSE WINDOW, be aware that the state is not automatically saved.
- External controllers and keyboard seems not to be working, expecially in the desktop mode.
