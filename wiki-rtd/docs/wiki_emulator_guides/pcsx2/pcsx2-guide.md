## Where to put the games

Playstation 2 games should be put under the `retrodeck/roms/ps2/` directory.

PCSX2 supports the following formats: `ISO` `BIN with CUE files` `CHD`


## Does PCSX2 require BIOS or Firmware?

Yes, they need to be put directly into the `retrodeck/bios/` without any subfolder.


## How to enable/disable Multitap?
