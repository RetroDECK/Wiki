# Guide: GZDoom

GZDoom is the open source game engine for ID Software's older games like DOOM, DOOM2, HEXEN and HERETIC or it's own unique games.

[ZDoom Forums](https://forum.zdoom.org/)

### Freedoom

The Freedoom project aims to provide all the content needed to form a complete, entirely free/libre game for the Doom engine.

It is designed to be compatible with most custom levels, music, graphics and other modifications (“mods”) made for the original Doom games by Doom fans and artists over the decades.

### Where to buy official DOOM?

We recommend that you at buy both `DOOM 1993` and `DOOM 2`.

`DOOM 3` and `DOOM 64` are not needed but we list them here because it is sometimes cheaper to buy the whole bundle.
