## RetroDECK - Steam Deck Hotkey Templates

RetroDECK ships with two different templates for the Steam Deck: `RetroDECK: Steam Deck - Neptune SIMPLE` and `RetroDECK: Steam Deck - Neptune FULL` with the only difference being the complexity of the built in radial menus and the amount of options at your disposal on the left touchpad.

Both layouts have the same button hotkeys seen on this page.

## Radial Menu System

The radial menu system is located on the left touchpad on the Steam Deck with layout depending on what layout you choose.
