Assuming this isn't the first time Steam Sync has been run, the process is:
Look through all gamelists and build a full list of all favorites in all systems
Build a JSON object for each favorite, which prepares to make a shortcut in Steam with the command "flatpak run net.retrodeck.retrodeck -s <system> <game path>" which leverages the new RetroDECK option to launch a ROM directly.
Write these JSON objects to a new temporary file
Check the new temporary file vs the existing favorites manifest. If different, continue, if the same, nothing has changed and can stop.
If files are different, find out if the original has entries the new one does not (meaning a favorite was removed). If so, build another temporary manifest of only games that were removed from favorites.
Load "removed games" manifest and run SRM to remove only those shortcuts.
Load new favorites list manifest and run SRM to add those shortcuts.
Temporary new favorites list becomes current favorites manifest, all other temp files removed.
