## Before You Begin

- Always back up the original ROM before patching or modifying anything.  
- BPS patches are recommended due to better accuracy and safety.  
- Ensure the ROM used is the exact version required by the patch.  
- Errors generally indicate a mismatched or modified base ROM.  
- When applying multiple ROM hacks, **check compatibility** and follow the **recommended order**, as it can vary for each hack.
