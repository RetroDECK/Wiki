## HEY YOU?! RetroDECK Team Where is the add to Steam Function? 👿

With the focus of both removing Yuzu and Citra + implementing ES-DE 3.0 changes. It is working, but we still have some small bugs to fix before we can release it. In this case it is better to move it to another patch, hopefully a minor patch like 0.8.X.
