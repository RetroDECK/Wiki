# RetroDECK Libraries


<img src="../../../wiki_icons/pixelitos/folder-red-activities.png" width="75">

Libraries in RetroDECK can live in three main places. This structure helps keep things clean, efficient, and modular.

## Library Priority Order

| Location                        | Purpose                                                                                          | Notes                                                                                          |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. lib/** | Acts like an **OS layer** for Flatpak. Most common libraries are already available here.         | You can browse these **Freedesktop Runtime** libraries from inside the Flatpak shell or from the host OS.                       |
| **2. components/shared-libs/**     | Is a component that holds **Shared Libraries** used by multiple components (like Qt). Helps avoid duplication.        | Organized into subfolders by version (e.g. `qt-5.15/`, `qt-6.8/`) to prevent version conflicts.       |
| **3. components/<component>/lib/**   | Contains **component-specific libraries** not found in the runtime or shared-libs.               | Usually includes libraries built with the app in its original Flatpak manifest.                |

## shared-libs Component (Shared Libraries)

Is a component that handles various shared libraries that are being used my other components. 

It is built as it's own component during the assembler build process and results in the `shared-libs.tar.gz` artifact.

When installed in retrodeck the artifact is extracted into:

`/components/shared-libs/`

That is organized into subfolders by version (e.g. `qt-5.15/`, `qt-6.8/` ) to prevent version conflicts.

### How-to: Add a library to shared-libs?

On the [GitHub: shared-libs / cooker](https://github.com/RetroDECK/components/tree/cooker/shared-libs) exists a pair of files (a txt and a yml) that tells the assembler what libraries in a specific version to build and add into the subfolders. 

You need to create both or just update the txt file if only a library is missing from a specific version.

**shared-libs.6.8.yml**

The .yml file tells how to build in this case org.kde.Platform (KDE Framework) version 6.8.

```
app-id: net.retrodeck.shared-libs
runtime: org.kde.Platform
runtime-version: &runtime-version '6.8'
sdk: org.kde.Sdk

add-extensions:
  org.freedesktop.Platform.ffmpeg-full:
    directory: lib/ffmpeg
    add-ld-path: .
    version: *runtime-version
    no-autodownload: true
    autodelete: false

cleanup:
  - "/include"
  - "/lib/pkgconfig"
  - "/lib/debug"

modules:

  - name: shared-libs.6.8
    buildsystem: simple
    build-commands:
      - |
        source ./search_libs.sh
        search_libs "shared-libs-6.8.txt"
    sources:
      - type: dir
        path: .
      - type: file
        path: ../automation-tools/search_libs.sh
```


**shared-libs-6.8.txt**

Contains the list of libraries that will be build and part of the 6.8 folder. If you need to add a new specific library to the 6.8 version needed by a component, all you need to do is add it to the list via a pull request on the component repo cooker.

**Example:**

You are adding a new component to RetroDECK but it complains it needs `libQt6Network.so.6` to work. All you need to do is add it to the textfile and it will be added to the 6.8 folder during the build process.
