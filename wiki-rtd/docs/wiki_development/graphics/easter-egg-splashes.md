# RetroDECK Boot Splash / Logo

<img src="../../../wiki_images/logos/rd-esde-logo.svg" width="300">

## Main splash location

The main retrodeck splash is located in:

[res/splash.svg](https://github.com/RetroDECK/RetroDECK/blob/main/res/splash.svg)

This is used at all times unless it is being overridden by the Easter Egg function.

## Easter Egg function

The function is part of the [config/retrodeck/reference_lists/features.json](https://github.com/RetroDECK/RetroDECK/blob/cooker/config/retrodeck/reference_lists/features.json) json.

The `splash_screens"`  looks in the reference .svg files under: [res/extra_splashes/](https://github.com/RetroDECK/RetroDECK/blob/main/res/extra_splashes/) and overrides the bootlogo with one of the .svg files from the referense list.

```

    "new_year": {

      "end_date": "MMDD",
      "start_time": "MMDD",
      "end_time": "MMDD",
      "filename": "placeholder.svg"


```


**Example:**

```
 "splash_screens": {
    "new_year": {
      "start_date": "1231",
      "end_date": "0106",
      "start_time": "0000",
      "end_time": "2359",
      "filename": "newyear.svg"
    },
    "chinese_new_year": {

      "end_time": "2359",
      "filename": "rd-lunar-snake-splash.svg"
    },
```

Here we show both the New Year and Lunar New Year
