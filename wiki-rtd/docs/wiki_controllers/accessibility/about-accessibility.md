# Accessibility Controllers

Accessibility Controllers are specialized controllers designed for gamers with limited mobility. These controllers can be customized with swappable inputs controlled by the main hub of an adaptive controller. 

They provide a flexible and adaptable gaming experience by allowing users to connect various types of inputs, such as flight sticks, external joysticks, or buttons. 

This customization ensures that gamers with different needs can find a setup that works best for them, enhancing their overall gaming experience.
