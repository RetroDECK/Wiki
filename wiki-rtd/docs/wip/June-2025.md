## PerfectDark's Team Q&A's over at Lemmy

User PerfectDark did an Q&A interview with the RetroDECK Team and others over at Lemmy they are worth a read!

## New Component System

In version **0.10.0b**, RetroDECK introduces a completely new method for adding and updating components.

Each component is now built inside its **own sub-sandbox** within the main RetroDECK sandbox.Â  
This change eliminates the **library and dependency conflicts** that have caused issues in the past.

This is a **complete rewrite** of how RetroDECK builds and accesses components.

**Key improvements:**

- Each component is isolated in its own environment.
- Components ship with their own libraries.
- We can still cross-reference shared libraries between components to minimize disk usage.
- Adding and updating components is now much easier and more reliable, thanks to the modular sandbox structure.

This new system provides a cleaner, more reliable, and scalable way to manage components going forward.

Everything will be built with out new Component / Project builder called: **RetroDECK Assembler** that is a part of the **RetroDECK Framework**.

We are also switching runtime from: **KDE Framework** to **Freedesktop** to allow us to be more modular.

### What are components?

A component is a complete packaged executable of:

- Emulators
- Engines
- Ports
- Systems
- RetroDECK

## RetroDECK API

Starting with **RetroDECK 0.10.0b**, weâ€™re introducing the **RetroDECK API** â€” a new way for external applications to interact with the RetroDECK Framework.

The API allows external tools to:

- Access internal RetroDECK data
- Trigger actions within the framework
- All functionality in the RetroDECK Configurator is now fully routed via the API instead.

**Access Methods**

Currently, the API is accessible via:

- Named pipes
- Internal calls within the RetroDECK Framework

Additional communication methods may be added in future releases.

**Why It Matters**

This API lays the foundation for:

- Better automation and scripting support
- External UI tools or launchers
- Easier integration with third-party systems


## W.I.P Development Guides

The team is actively working on a full set of updated development guides.  
These are still **work-in-progress** and subject to frequent major changes and more guides will be added.

## What does it all mean?! 

**Mr. A User:**

*"Gosh Golly RetroDECK Team! I have a hard time following the technobabble, what does it all mean?!"*

**Thalin:**

*"What will happen to RetroDECK?!"*

Well dear users thanks for the questions, let us try to explain.

### New Component System 

This new system allows us to:

- Add new components (Emulators, Ports, Systems, Engines) faster and more easily.
- Ship updates for existing components more quickly than before.

This directly addresses the **#1 frustration from YOU, our userbase**: slow component update cycles.

We made it a priority to solve this in 0.10.0b â€” even though it is a highly complex and time-consuming task.

**Important Note**

This doesnâ€™t mean users can update components themselves â€” sandbox limitations still apply.Â  
However, it **does** mean we can push updates out **much faster** than before in theory.



#### In Other Words...
 
**User A:**

*"RetroArch just dropped a new version 3 seconds ago and RetroDECK still hasnâ€™t updated?!* 
*What is this, the stone age? Slowest Team ever!"*

**User B:**

*Hey, can you add this brand new emulator/port/system/engine?* 
*Like... now. Or yesterday. But now is fine too. Thanks!"*

**Thalin:**

*"Why is nothing happening to RetroDECK?!"*

We hear you â€” and this new system is our answer.


### RetroDECK API

The RetroDECK API is the new foundation for the upcoming **Godot-based Configurator**, which will replace the legacy Configurator in future releases.

But itâ€™s more than just an internal tool.

The API is designed to be open and flexible â€” allowing **other developers** to build their own tools and interfaces that integrate with RetroDECK.

Think of it as a **"Build-Your-Own-Configurator"** LEGO kit.

## Summer Update: Slower Pace in July

Many members of the RetroDECK Team will be occupied with real-life commitments during the summer period, including:

- Vacations
- Home improvement projects
- Family time 
- ...and other well-deserved breaks

**As a result:**

- There will be no blog post published in July.
- Team activity on social channels may be reduced during this time.


### That is all for now 

There are more things we are working on, but you will see them in future blog updates!

And as always if you want to help with development join the ðŸ’™-i-want-to-help channel on Discord.

Thanks everyone!
