## ImCoKeMaN & PM Team - Added more ports

Community member ImCoKeMaN have helped the PortMaster Team getting more X86_64 ports available and thus they are in RetroDECK.

So far about 30 new ports have appeared.

We give ImCoKeMaN and the PortMaster Team our biggest thanks. 

## RetroDECK 0.10.0b - Status

<img src="../../../icon-component.svg" width="75"> 

RetroDECK 0.10.0b is advancing under the “Project Neo” umbrella, that we first talked about in June.

We’re still addressing component‑specific issues, so the final release will take additional time and no ETAs. We’re rebuilding large portions of the application and its build pipeline from the ground up—making this effort feel more like **RetroDECK II** or **RetroDECK Neo**, which explains the project name.

We are doing a mix of:

- **Adding new and old components** to the new architecture and make them run. <- We are focused here currently.
- **Updating configuration files** for each component to align with the new structure. 
- **Adapt all** Configurator Tools and functions. 
- Conduct extensive **testing and bug‑fixing**.
- **Writing documentation** for the wiki.

We’re also integrating numerous new components, with the update’s focus centered on these enhancements.
