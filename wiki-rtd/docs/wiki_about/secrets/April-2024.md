Highlights:

- Bonsai Banana Released
- PortMaster

<!-- more -->

## Bonsai Banana - Released

We thank everyone for your patience.

The update was hard to get out as it needed major back-end changeds to accommodate both Ponzu and all the major structural changes brought by the ES-DE 3.0 update.

We opted for an more extended testing period as well to make sure everything was as safe as possible, but as always there will be bugs we have missed and no software is bug free.

We are montitoring the issues people are having on Discord, Matrix, Reddit, Lemmy and other places. We have have complied a list of things to look into for the bugfix a 0.8.1b . So far no severe totaly application colappsing issues have been reported.

Custom ES-DE Collections, as they where never handled by RetroDECK proper and moved into the /retrodeck folder but we plan to address them in an upcoming update and move them to a safer location.

## PortMaster and RetroDECK

We have been working with parts of PortMaster Team and other passionate developers that want to bring [PortMaster](https://portmaster.games/index.html) to RetroDECK and x86_64 systems.

Here is a video of an early POC one developer made

This is still very early and if or even when this will fully ship we don't know yet :)

We still did want to show the community that we are not sitting back idle, but working on cool stuff behind the scenes.

### What is PortMaster?

It is a Linux Port Manager to easy download, manage, create and play various Linux game ports.
In many of the ports you will need to own game and take files from the original game for the ports to work.

For a full gamelist check here:

### There exists other ways to run the same games?!

Yes, there exists many ways to run these ports and games outside of PortMaster.

PortMaster was born from the scope of arm based handheld gaming devices as a way to play games not available for those systems.

For certain ports it might make more sense to install them directly via:

- [Luxtorpeda](https://github.com/dreamer/luxtorpeda)
- [Lutris](https://lutris.net/)
- [Flathub](https://flathub.org/en)
- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/)
- [Heroic](https://heroicgameslauncher.com/)
- [MiniGalaxy](https://sharkwouter.github.io/minigalaxy/)

Some ports are however very hard to install for the avarage user and PortMaster makes it a breeze to install.

What we are doing is proving you with a new option within RetroDECK.

## I don't care about any of this, I just want to add my games to Steam!

The team is working on integrating a already pre-configured SRM (Steam Rom Manager) within RetroDECK with several functions exposed in the configurator.

And...we know how you feel, it is by far the:

## That is all for April
