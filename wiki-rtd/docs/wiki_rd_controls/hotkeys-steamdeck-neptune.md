## Radial Menu System

The radial menu system is located on the left touchpad on the Steam Deck with layout depending on what layout you choose.

RetroDECK ships with two different templates for the Steam Deck:

`RetroDECK: Steam Deck - Neptune SIMPLE`

`RetroDECK: Steam Deck - Neptune FULL`

The only difference being the complexity of the built-in radial menus and the amount of options at your disposal on the left touchpad.

### The FULL Layout

### The SIMPLE Layout

The SIMPLE layout got the same menu as the external controllers.
