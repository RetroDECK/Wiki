## RetroDECK - Steam Deck Hotkey Layouts

RetroDECK from the 0.8.0b ships with two different layouts for the Steam Deck: `RetroDECK: Steam Deck - Neptune <version number> SIMPLE` and `RetroDECK: Steam Deck - Neptune <version number> FULL` with the only difference being the complexity of the built in radial menus and the amount of options at your disposal on the left touchpad.

Both layouts have the same button hotkeys seen on this page.

### The hotkey button
The global hotkeys are activated by pressing and holding the `HKB` aka the `HotKey Button` and pressing the corresponing button togheter for the command you want to do.
On the Steam Deck can be either `L4`, `R4` and `Select` depending on what is closest for the button combo you are trying to press.

**Example:**

You want to do the command `Pause / Resume`. <br>
You press and hold either `L4` or `R4` or `Select` and press `A` to trigger the command.

### Global Hotkeys: Button Combos list
The global hotkeys are activated by pressing the hotkey button and holding it while pressing the corresponding other button input.
What follows is a list of hotkeys:

`Function` Shows what the hotkey does. <br>
`Button / Combination` Shows the input you need to make to trigger the command. <br>
`Command` Shows what is being sent to the emulator. <br>
`Emulator Support` Shows what emulators support the command. <br>
`Comment` Just extra comments. <br>
