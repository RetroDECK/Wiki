## The bad news - Postponing Godot Configurator

We are postponing the release of the Godot Configurator to a later major version to incorporate valuable feedback from our team and community testers. 

Since we have already delayed version 0.9.0b for a long time, we decided to move the Godot Configurator to a future version. 

We are eager to release the next major update to the public!

## The good news - 0.9.0 Captain Comeback very soon

The good news is that version 0.9.0b is coming very soon! 

We are in the final stages of testing with our community testers, squashing minor bugs and tweaking small things based on feedback. 

If you want to help with the testing effort, join the ðŸ’™-i-want-to-help channel on Discord.

## We have updated the wiki with new content

If you are an avid visitor to the wiki, you might have noticed that we have restructured some sections and added more information to various articles. 

More importantly, we have added all the new guides for version 0.9.0b:

[PortMaster Guide](https://retrodeck.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wiki_system_guides/portmaster/portmaster-guide/)

[SRM / Steam Sync Guide](https://retrodeck.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wiki_system_guides/srm/srm-guide/)

[RetroENGINE Guide](https://retrodeck.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wiki_system_guides/retroengine/retroengine-guide/)

[Ruffle Guide](https://retrodeck.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wiki_emulator_guides/ruffle/ruffle-guide/)

## That is all for now 

There are more things we are working on, but you will see them in future blog updates!
  
Thanks everyone!
