## ImCoKeMaN & PM Team - Added more ports

Community member ImCoKeMaN have helped the PortMaster Team getting more X86_64 ports available in RetroDECK.

So far about 30 new ports have appeared.

We give ImCoKeMaN and the PortMaster Team our biggest thanks. 

## RetroDECK 0.10.0b - Status

<img src="../../../icon-component.svg" width="75"> 

RetroDECK‚ÄØ0.10.0b is advancing under the ‚ÄúProject‚ÄØNeo‚Äù umbrella, that we first talked about in June.

We‚Äôre still addressing component‚Äëspecific issues, so the final release will take additional time and no ETAs. We‚Äôre rebuilding large portions of the application and its build pipeline from the ground up‚Äîmaking this effort feel more like **RetroDECK‚ÄØII** or **RetroDECK‚ÄØNeo**, which explains the project name.

We are doing a mix of:

- **Adding new and old components** to the new architecture and make them run. <- We are focused here currently.
- **Updating configuration files** for each component to align with the new structure. 
- **Adapt all** Configurator Tools and functions. 
- Conduct extensive **testing and bug‚Äëfixing**.
- **Writing documentation** for the wiki.

We‚Äôre also integrating numerous new components, with the update‚Äôs focus centered on these enhancements.
