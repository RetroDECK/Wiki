## HEY YOU?! RetroDECK Team Where is the add to Steam Function? 👿

With the focus of both removing Yuzu and Citra + implementing ES-DE 3.0 changes. It is working, but we still have some small bugs to fix before we can release it. In this case it is better to move it to another patch, hopefully a minor patch like 0.8.X.

## External Controller profiles

All controller profiles uses the same one layer radial menu with good to have hotkeys in addition to the normal button hotkeys. To access the radial menu press and hold SELECT + Move the Left Joystick and Press L3 to press the radial button.


### The external controller radial menu

It features a variety of PC commands and other commands that are good to have. While the most important commands are bound to the normal button combos.

## External Controller Issues - Steam Deck

- Sometimes the emulators / engines gets confused on what controller is player 1 and takes the docked Steam Deck as player 1 and not the external contrller. You can solve this by going into the Reorder Controllers interface in Steam and try switching between Player 1 or Player 2.


## External Controller Issues - Linux Desktop

Linux Desktop via Steam Input is complex. There are a lot of variables and the RetroDECK Team don't have the ability to test for all of them:

- What kind of packages are installed.
- What kind of drivers you have installed.
- What distro you are using.
- What desktop you are using.
- If you are running X11 or Wayland.
- If you have a Steam Deck based Distro with Valves "Game Mode".

We are trying to keep track of all the issues here and have reported several to Valve:

https://github.com/XargonWan/RetroDECK/issues/716

**Bug: Destop Profiles take preset over Game Profile**

Since the one of the recent Steam Client updates, there is a bug that causes Steam to take the Desktop Profile instead of the Game Profile. Sometimes it even takes both inputs and sends double inputs for every action.

Possible solutions by our users and team members:

- Try and use the RetroDECK Profile as the Desktop Profile and turning off the Game Profile.
- Going into big picture and launching RetroDECK from there.
- Starting big picture, exiting big picture and then launching RetroDECK from the Desktop Client.

**Bug: Missing Radials in certain systems**

The radial menus on certain Linux Systems are hidden behind the game window or the Steam overlay (they still work and you can navigate them).

We thought about doing a temporary none radial profiles for each controller to get around this bug.<br>
But later changed our minds as we would have even more input configs to maintain, with a risk they become permanent.

## External Controller Issues - GZDOOM

GZDOOM have some kind of conflict with Steam Input in when more then one controller that causes input looping in menus. Make sure that the controller you are using is set as Player 1 else use Reorder Controllers interface in Steam to make it Player 1.

We are still investigation the cause of it, if you know of a solution please contact the RetroDECK Team.

## Framework

- Removed talk names in the manifest as they're not needed anymore as enabled by default.
- The retrodeck/logs folder is no longer hidden by default.
- Created a quit_retrodeck function to ease the quit in the scripts.
- Fixed: Various issues when building RetroDECK locally for development.

## Configurator

- Fixed: Quit button after emulators reset should act as an actual full quit button.

## Ponzu

Ponzu is in part the former Yuzu (Custom) AppImage loader and tool that we had planned for 0.8.0b. If the user has personal backups of the last versions of the now dead emulators in AppImage format they can temporarily be used with RetroDECK as-is.

https://retrodeck.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wiki_configurator/ponzu/

### Should this be seen as official support for the removed emulators?

No, the only official and supported defaults are Ryujinx and Citra-core in RetroArch.

RetroDECK will not provide any new: configs, bugfixes, improvements or support towards the AppImages. There is also a risk that future updates can break the compatibility with the AppImages (because they are no longer maintained and dead), this is a as-is solution.

We strongly recommenced everyone to just use Ponzu as a way to safely migrate to Ryujinx or the Citra-core (save and move).

### Will you be looking in into other forks of Citra & Yuzu later and add into RetroDECK?

First, this type of event makes it ripe for scammers.

We would urge all users to be extra careful and not blindly downloading everything you see on the internet including fan fixes for the dead emulators.

If good, safe and ethical forks arises that have been vetted by the FOSS community...we will look into it.
