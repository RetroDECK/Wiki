## NetPlay/Online experiments

<img src="../../../netplay.webp"">
<img src="../../../netplay2.webp"">

This is just a experiment of a Online play function we are working on, with the goal of providing a unified online play tool accross all the engines / emulators.

We looking into the ability to pipe all online services into this function:

- RetroArch Netplay
- Pretendo
- Dolphin Rooms
- PCSX2 Rooms
- and more

The screenshot is just a POC of the function and we hope to ship it with a nice godot interface like the upcoming configurator.

## 0.9.0b

The work on the next major version have already begun and it will take time before it is released.

### Ruffle

Helper MonkeyX have made progress of integrating the Flash Emulator Ruffle into

### Upgraded QT Package

Dolphin and Primehack had some issues that prevented us to updated to the latest freedesktop QT Package, those have now been fixed (look at the shutout we gave in the May blogpost). As part of the 0.9.0b we will be upgrading to the latest version.

## Summer time

- Vacation time (a bit slower development during the summer)
- Wish everyone a happy summer


## That is all for now

Thanks everyone!
