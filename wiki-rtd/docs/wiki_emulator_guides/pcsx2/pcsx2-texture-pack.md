#  PCSX2 - Texture Pack Guide
The `~/retrodeck/texture_packs/PCSX2/` represents the `/PCSX2/textures/` folder in PCSX2.

Some texture packs could made for a specific version or region of a game. Make sure you have the right game and textures for it.

`TITLEID` is different for every game.

### Globally for all games

1. Go to `Settings` -> `Graphics` -> `Texture Replacement`
2. Enable `Load Textures` and `Async Texture Loading`.

### Per game

**NOTE:** On the Steam Deck this could be easier to do in `Desktop Mode`.


### Texture folder directly

1. Extract any texture pack files from compressed `.zip` or any other format into folders.
2. Go into `~/retrodeck/texture_packs/PCSX2/`. The folders are all named by `TITLEID`.
3. Move textures into the right `~/retrodeck/texture_packs/PCSX2/<TITLEID>` folder.
