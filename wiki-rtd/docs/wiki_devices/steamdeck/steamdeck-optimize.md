<img src="../../../wiki_icons/pixelitos/steam.png" width="75">

These optimizations are entirely optional and but they can give you better performance on some more demanding emulators.

This increases the VRAM to 4GB in the BIOS, this can give you improvements in certain emulators.

- Click on `Setup Utility`
- Click on `Advanced`
- Change`UMA Frame buffer Size` to 4GB
- Save and Exit

## Setup a sudo password

This is a requirement for many optimizations and solutions, it also makes your Deck safer.
It enables you to run commands/applications heighten sudo privileges.

- Go to `Desktop Mode`
- Open `Konsole` or another `Terminal`
- Type `passwd`
