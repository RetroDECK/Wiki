## RetroDECK 0.10.0b - Status

<img src="../../../icon-component.svg" width="75"> 

RetroDECK 0.10.0b is slowly progressing, under the umbrella "Project Neo" as we explained in back in June.

We are still resolving various issues per component basis and it will still take a while to get over the finish line. 

In a sense we are rebuilding many parts of the application and build process from scratch, it's more akin to a RetroDECK II or RetroDECK Neo (hence the name Project Neo).

We are also trying to cram a lot of new components into it, where the focus of the update is. 

The plan is:

1. Make all components run in the new structure.
2. Configure all the config files that each component to match the new structure. 
3. Make all the tools respect the new structure.
4. Tons of testing and bugfixing.

## So what new components are you trying to add?

We are experimenting with several components at once and we might hold some back to a later update if they are taking too much time.

These are not 100% set in stone. 

But the current list of new components cooker are the following.

### Azahar

### Dosbox-X

### EKA2L1 

### Lindbergh Loader

### Flycast

### Mudlet

### OpenBOR

### Ryubing

Replaces the semi-broken Ryujinx legacy build. 

### Simcoupe

### ScummVM-SA

The full Standalone version of ScummVM

### VpinballX

### XRoar

---

## What components are after that?

### Ares

### Gargoyle

### KEGS

### RAZE

### ShadPS4

### SuperModel

### Xenia

### Medafen

## That is all for now 

There are more things we are working on, but you will see them in future blog updates!
