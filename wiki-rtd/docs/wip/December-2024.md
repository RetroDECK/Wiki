## Thanks Lx32 and dottormac

Special thanks to former RetroDECK Team members Lx32 & dottormac for their contributions.
They are now RetroDECK Alumni with special roles on Discord. 

Life can sometimes pull us away from contributing to open source projects. We want to extend our heartfelt thanks to:

- dottormac for their significant help with early testing of RetroDECK.
- Lx32 for focusing on the SRM implementation, and for his earlier work on BoilR to finally add games to Steam.

We wish them a happy journey ahead. Keep in touch, Itakatta! 🤌🍕🍝🍌🤌 ❤️
