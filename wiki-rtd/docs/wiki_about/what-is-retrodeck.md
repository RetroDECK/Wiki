## What is RetroDECK?

RetroDECK is a [ES-DE Frontend](https://es-de.org) powered [Flatpak](https://flathub.org/apps/net.retrodeck.retrodeck) all-in-one game application that is still in development. Thanks to its `RetroDECK Framework` it builds-in a variety of software (that runs your games) like emulators and game engines in one package that is pre-configured.

### RetroDECK is easy to install

As all you need is to download it from flathub via your software center like KDE Discover or Gnome Software.

### RetroDECK is easy to update

As it updates from your software center like all other system updates.

### RetroDECK is contained

By being an all-in-one flatpak application RetroDECK is sandboxed and contained. Thus put all important files from all software in a minimal amount of locations, instead of having them spread out over your entire system. That also makes RetroDECK very easy to remove and clean-up (if you so wish).

### RetroDECK Configurator

RetroDECK features the RetroDECK Configurator that is accessible from the ES-DE main menu to allow you to change / configure settings across many systems from one interface. You can read more about the RetroDECK Configurator in the `RetroDECK: What is included?` down the page.

### RetroDECK saves space

RetroDECK also saves space comparing to installing all emulators separately as we can cross reference libraries and functions the Emulators / Engines have in common and only ship one instead of several.

## Missing Features and BETA Period

We plan to add more emulators, engines, systems, and functions over the course of the development cycle.

We do not have any plans to ship all emulators, engines, or systems in existence for each game system or console. The goal is to ship those that handle that system the best with the most features and we are allowed to ship.
