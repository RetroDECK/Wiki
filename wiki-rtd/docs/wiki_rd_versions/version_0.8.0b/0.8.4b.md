# RetroDECK 0.8.4b

**Release date:** 2024-08-XX



##  RetroDECK Framework / Backend:

We fixed several issues with downloaded scraped data not showing up in ES-DE.

Some of these issues were caused by the old manifest structure and certain Zenity dialogs. We will be moving away from Zenity and are making a brand new RetroDECK manifest 0.9.0b .


**Fixed:**

- Folders were not correctly placed and moved from `retrodeck/` to the new folder structure under the `retrodeck/ES-DE` in some scenarios for users causing the ES-DE data to be not found by ES-DE.

- String values of es_settings were not updated for `MediaDirectory` and `UserThemeDirectory` in some scenarios for users causing the ES-DE data to be not found by ES-DE.

- On new installations two folders could be created for scraped data, one `downloaded_media` under `retrodeck/` and one under `retrodeck/ES-DE`.
