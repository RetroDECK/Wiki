## New Lighter Manifest & Framework changes

Over the past several months, we have made significant improvements to RetroDECK, resulting in over `1300+` commits since the last release. Key updates include:

- Reduced application size by approximately `600MB` / `40%` 🧑‍🔬 compared to `0.8.4b` (some of this space have been taken by new features).
- Decreased the build time from `3.30` hours to about `1` hour.
- Transitioned to a modular build approach, where each component is built separately and then integrated into RetroDECK.
- Migrated to a GitHub organization, which now hosts the new modular structure.
- Restructured folders and paths, reducing several layers of subfolders.
- Reworked the `pre_build_automation script`, adding new features.
- Improved logging.
- Implemented changes for the future Godot version of the Configurator.
- Enabled the RetroDECK Framework to pick up logged-in Steam profiles for systems like SRM.
- Created a new library manager called LibMan 🦸. It ensures each component brings its own libraries when built from outsourced modules.
- Migrated from AppData to MetaInfo.
- Post-update options condensed into a single **Zenity** window. 
- Better local building support and PR building workflow.

These improvements will continue in upcoming major updates as we aim to make the build system more dynamic and developer-friendly.

## RetroENGINE - Run with RetroDECK

<img src="../../../wiki_images/systems/retroengine/re-appselect.png" width="500"> 

RetroDECK can be used as a headless engine to run your games. 

On the Linux Desktop (or desktop mode), we have added the option to associate, run, and open various game files directly with RetroDECK. 

This also includes the ability to launch games via the CLI.

This feature has been requested by the wider development community outside of RetroDECK (and maybe a few Linux Wizard Grognards that only want to use CLI for everything).

We can't wait to see what other developers do with it.

**Quote from Discord User:**

*"Whoa! That is a lot of text for saying you can now double click on game files and they open"*

## Steam Rom Manager & Steam Sync

<img src="../../../wiki_images/logos/srm-logo.png" width="100">

RetroDECK is now shipping with [Steam Rom Manager](https://steamgriddb.github.io/steam-rom-manager/) and the ability to Sync your games to Steam aka `Steam Sync` built-in. 

**Note: Flatpak Steam Not Yet Supported**

We have not yet added support for the Flatpak version of Steam.


**What is Steam Rom Manager?**

Steam Rom Manager is a bulk game importer and artwork manager for Steam.

It adds separate games to Steam, incorporates artwork from [SteamGridDB](https://www.steamgriddb.com/) , and configures the RetroDECK Steam Input layouts. 


**What is Steam Sync?**

`Steam Sync` is a RetroDECK feature that uses Steam Rom Manager to Sync your favorite games in ES-DE to Steam.

## New Feature - PortMaster

<img src="../../../wiki_images/logos/portmaster-logo.png" width="100">

RetroDECK is now shipping with [PortMaster](https://portmaster.games/).

### What is PortMaster?

PortMaster is a simple GUI tool designed to make downloading and installing game ports for Linux devices easy and self-contained within RetroDECK, allowing it to auto-update.

One of its goals is to avoid installing or upgrading any existing OS libraries for any ports. Any ports that need a particular non-standard library are maintained within the ports' folder and made available specifically to that port during execution.

## New Feature - Ruffle

## New RetroDECK ES-DE Theme

We have released the first version of our own RetroDECK ES-DE theme! 

<img src="../RetroDECKESDE1.webp" width="600">

<img src="../RetroDECKESDE2.webp" width="600"> 

The theme is inspired by the Mini Banner theme made for Launchbox and the ES-DE-Mini theme made for ES-DE. Our RetroDECK theme can be seen as a remix of these themes.

The original themes were created by:

`Weestuarty`, `DerSchlachter` and `Dan Patrick`.

The RetroDECK theme features:

- RetroDECK inspired colors and graphics.
- Different types of submenus and layouts compared to Mini Banner & ES-DE-Mini.
- Icons for RetroDECK features like PortMaster.


The new theme is made by: `Weestuarty`

### ES-DE

<img src="../../../wiki_images/logos/es-de-logo.png" width="100">

[ES-DE: Changelog](https://gitlab.com/es-de/emulationstation-de/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)


**Note:** 

The new update brings a lot of exciting features, including language support. For more details, you can refer to the changelog above. 

By default, ES-DE will set the language to match your system locale if a translation is available.

If you wish to change the language, you can do so by navigating to `ES-DE Configurations` -> `UI Settings` -> `Application Language`.

**Changes:** 

- Favorites collection is now enabled by default on ES-DE.
- The ES-DE settings are now under a submenu in the ES-DE frontend to prevent the menu from becoming too crowded - `ES-DE Configurations`.
-  ES-DE first setup screen is replaced by a new message from guiding users where to place their data.


**Added:** 

- Added support for the Panda3DS and LRPS2 RetroArch cores in ES-DE.

**Fixed:** 

- The scraper was set to `Europe` instead of `World`.


**Known Issue:** 

- The `ES-DE Configurations` submenu in RetroDECK's ES-DE doesn't support translations yet. We hope to implement all translations in the future.
