## Bonsai Banana - Released

We thank everyone for your patience

## PortMaster ❤️ RetroDECK

We are proud to announce that the parts of the RetroDECK Team, Batocera Team and PortMaster Team is going bring [PortMaster](https://portmaster.games/index.html) to x86_64 systems.

RetroDECK's goal is to have it ship natively and built-in... and guess what?!

It already works in our early POC!

Not all ports have x86_64 versions but more will be added over time and a lot of work left to do for all of us.

### What is PortMaster?

It is a Linux Port Manager to easy download, manage, create and play various Linux game ports.
In many of the ports you will need to own game and take files from the original game for the ports to work.

For a full gamelist check here:

### There exists other ways to run the same games?!

Yes, there exists many ways to run these ports and games outside of PortMaster.

PortMaster was born from the handeld gaming devices as a way to play these games on something like the Miyoo Mini.

For certain ports it might make more sense to install them directly via options and their runners:

- [Luxtorpeda](https://github.com/dreamer/luxtorpeda)
- [Lutris](https://lutris.net/)
- [Flathub](https://flathub.org/en)
- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/)
- [Heroic](https://heroicgameslauncher.com/)
- [MiniGalaxy](https://sharkwouter.github.io/minigalaxy/)

Some ports are however very hard to install for the avarage user and PortMaster makes it a breeze to install most of them.

What are doing is proving you with a new option within RetroDECK.

## That is all for April

Thanks everyone!
