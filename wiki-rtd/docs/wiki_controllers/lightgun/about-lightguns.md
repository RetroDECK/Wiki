# Lightgun Controllers

Lightgun Controllers are special types of controllers used to play lightgun games. These controllers are designed to simulate the experience of shooting a gun at targets on the screen. They come in various forms, including first-party controllers, third-party controllers, DIY projects, and open-source projects.

Lightgun games typically involve aiming the lightgun at the screen and pulling the trigger to hit targets. The technology behind lightguns varies, with some using infrared sensors, while others use camera-based systems to track the gun's position.

Not all Lightguns have Linux support, and RetroDECK currently does not support lightgun inputs in a easy manner.
