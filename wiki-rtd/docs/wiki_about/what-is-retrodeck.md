## What is RetroDECK?

RetroDECK is a powerful all-in-one retro gaming platform designed for handheld gaming PCs like the Steam Deck, full Linux desktops, Linux HTPC setups, and Linux-based PC consoles such as the Steam Machine. Delivered as a self-contained Flatpak app, it gives you everything you need for retro gaming right out of the box, no manual setup required. By integrating a wide range of components such as emulators, game engines, ports, and built-in tools, RetroDECK brings all your favorite games together in one streamlined, easy-to-use package.

### Key Components

- **RetroDECK Framework** – Enhances emulators and the ES-DE interface for deeper integration and expanded functionality.  
- **RetroDECK RetroENGINE** – A headless game runner designed for power users and developers.  
- **RetroDECK Configurator** – A multi-tool utility that lets you adjust system settings without navigating individual emulator menus.

## Easy to Install

You can download RetroDECK from Flathub using your preferred software center, such as **KDE Discover**, **Bazaar**, or **GNOME Software**.

---

## Easy to Update

RetroDECK updates automatically through your software center, just like any other Flatpak application.

---

## RetroDECK Is Contained

As a Flatpak, RetroDECK is **sandboxed and self-contained**.  
All important files are stored in a minimal number of locations instead of being scattered across your system. This makes RetroDECK both easier to maintain and simple to remove or clean up.

## RetroDECK Configurator

Accessible from the ES-DE main menu, the Configurator allows you to adjust and manage settings across multiple systems from a single interface.
