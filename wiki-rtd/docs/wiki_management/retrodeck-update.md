## Questions

### Updating After a Long Time?

If you haven't updated RetroDECK for a very long time (a year or more), it's better to uninstall and reinstall it from your software manager instead of upgrading. 

### Updating Specific Systems in RetroDECK?

You cannot update specific systems directly in RetroDECK. You will need to wait for new versions of RetroDECK to be released.
