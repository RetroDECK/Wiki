*The Giga CHD of a MAN vanished from the project, only to reappear later at his house on MAME Street. During his spiritual quest inside the project, he stumbled upon the lost Pico-8 wandering in the library woods and gently guided it back to the tiny hut where it lives alongside the other Pico numbers. Now, finally home and armed with fresh insights into deeper compression tricks, he's ready once again to serve the community, as the CHD he truly is.* 

- **COMPRESSION:** CHDMAN (.chd compression) is looking at the right paths and is now working again. <img src="../chdman.png" width="15"> 🏠

**Added:**

- **BACKUP:** Simplified the backup prompt and choices.
- **COMPRESSION:**  CHDMAN now also checks: arcade, atomiswave, cdimono1, cdtv, fmtowns, megacdjp, mess, naomi, neogeocdjp as valid compression targets.
- **FRAMEWORK:** Updated the handling of MelonDS new config format.
- **FRAMEWORK:** Added a verification step to ensure Steam Input controller layout files are always injected during post-update.
- **FRAMEWORK:** Migrated PortMaster and SRM data into their dedicated component files.
- **FOLDER ICONS:** Added a folder icon for PrimeHack.
- **PRIMEHACK:** Separated the PrimeHack component and added its own folder in `roms/primehack` based on user feedback.

**Changed:**

- **FRAMEWORK:** Updated the backup process to exclude log files, reducing the risk of corruption during writes.
