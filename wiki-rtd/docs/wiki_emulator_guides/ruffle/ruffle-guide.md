## Controls in Games

Most flash games where made for Mouse and Keyboard. 

All games are all different in how you control them and there is no standard universal Input Solution to account for all games.

There could be games that uses Keyboard: WASD, Arrow Keys, Numpad, Mouse and much more.

You can via RetroDECK's Steam Input Layouts:

- Emulate mouse input via joystick.
- Use built-in touchpads on the controller / devices like the DualSense or the Steam Deck.
- Use built-in touchscreens on devices like the Steam Deck.
- Use built-in virtual keyboards in SteamOS or your Linux distribution that can be summoned with a button combo. 
- Play with a real keyboard and mouse.

Check the controller guides on the wiki for more information on the controller / device.
