## What is Reiki? 

Reiki is a Gaming Cyber Shark.

A Shark of Games, if you will.

Her main feature is the modular dorsal fin, that she swaps to load the component she needs transforming her abilities and look in an instant. 

- UZDoom module? It's demon slaying time!

- C64 module? The power to collect star cells! 

- Mega Drive module? Gotta go fast!

Each fin grants her the perfect tools and skills for the challenge ahead, making her endlessly adaptable and always ready to dive headfirst into the next adventure.
