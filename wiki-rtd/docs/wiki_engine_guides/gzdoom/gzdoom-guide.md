## Does GZDOOM require BIOS or Firmware?

No, but will need copies of DOOM. 

### Where to buy official DOOM?

To get started, you will need to purchase `DOOM` and `DOOM II`.

While `DOOM 3` and `DOOM 64` 64 are not necessary, sometimes it's more cost-effective to buy the entire bundle.

### Freedoom

The Freedoom project aims to provide all the content needed to form a complete, entirely free/libre game for the Doom engine.

It is designed to be compatible with most custom levels, music, graphics, and other modifications ("mods") made for the original Doom games by Doom fans and artists over the decades.

### What is doom_complete.pk3?

`doom_complete.pk3` is a file made by [WadSmoosh](https://jp.itch.io/wadsmoosh). It can combine all of the "DOOM + DOOM 2 + Official addons" into one file where you can select from all the campaigns without needing to load each separate wad.

## Where can I find more WADs?

Non-official WADs (mods) are available across the internet on old forums, GitHub, and various websites.

### Doomworld

Doomworld is the oldest DOOM community on the web and hosts the annual [Cacowards](https://www.doomworld.com/cacowards). It is the lifeblood of the DOOM community, containing generations of knowledge and a vast collection of WADs.

## GZDoom Controls

**Known Issues**

- Multiple controllers for local multiplayer don't work well due to bugs between GZDoom and Steam Input.
- Set the primary controller as player one, especially if using an external controller with the Steam Deck. This prevents input loops.
- Avoid pressing "Save configur## Where to put the games?

WiiU games should be put under the `retrodeck/roms/wiiu/` directory.
ation" in the GZDoom options menu if you have mods that add extra controls, as it will wipe those extra controls. Inputs will still be saved without pressing save.

### Standard Controls

The controls are semi-based on the inputs from `Timesplitters: Future Perfect` for the PlayStation 2 and are described as an Xbox Layout style controller.

| Movement: Look Up / Down + Turn           |   `Right Joystick`     |                  |

### Mod Controls - Extras

Optional extra binds for certain `Project Brutality` or `Brutal Doom` based mods.

|  Action                                    |    Button        |    Comment      |
| :---                                      | :---:           |         :---:   |
| Quick Melee / Special Action              |   `L1`          |                 |
| Throw Grenade / Second Special Action     |   `L2`          |    Replaces Zoom (most DOOM mods use Secondary Fire for this anyhow)          |
| Dash                                      |   `R3`          |    Replaces Quick Turn           |

### The Mod Needs More Inputs

Many mods have more inputs than what is bindable on a controller. `L1`,  `L2`, `Dpad - Up`, `Dpad - Down` are mostly free for those types of actions.

- Bind `L1` and `L2` to more action-oriented things you need to use more often.
- Use `Dpad - Up`, `Dpad - Down` for things you use less often, like Extra Menus.
- If it is a new movement type that can replace quick turn, bind it on `R3` and replace Quick Turn or either of the `L1` or `L2`.

You are also free to change any of the default binds shipped by RetroDECK, and if you mess something up, you can always reset GZDoom via the Configurator.
