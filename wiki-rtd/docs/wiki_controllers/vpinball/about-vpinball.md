# Virtual Pinball (VPin / Vboard) Controllers

<img src="../../../wiki_images/controllers/vpinball.png" width="250">

Virtual pinball machines are digital recreations of traditional pinball machines, designed to provide an immersive pinball experience using modern technology. These machines typically feature a large screen to display the playfield, along with various physical controls and feedback mechanisms to simulate the feel of a real pinball machine.

## Types of virtual pinball machines

### Standalone Virtual Pinball Machines

These are complete units that include everything needed to play virtual pinball games. They often come with high-definition screens, realistic controls, and built-in software to run various pinball simulations.

### DIY Virtual Pinball Machines

For those who enjoy building their own machines, DIY kits are available. These kits provide the necessary components, such as screens, buttons, and software, allowing users to assemble and customize their own virtual pinball machines.

### Hybrid Virtual Pinball Machines

These machines combine elements of both traditional and virtual pinball. They may feature physical pinball components, such as bumpers and flippers, along with digital displays and software to enhance the gameplay experience.

### Portable Virtual Pinball Machines

Designed for portability, these machines are smaller and more compact, making them easy to transport and set up in different locations. They often feature foldable screens and detachable controls.

### Arcade-Style Virtual Pinball Machines 

These machines are designed to mimic the look and feel of classic arcade pinball machines. They often feature large cabinets, vibrant artwork, and high-quality sound systems to create an authentic arcade experience.

## Inputs and Outputs in Virtual Pinball Machines

Virtual pinball machines have a variety of inputs and outputs to simulate the experience of playing a real pinball machine. 

- **Flipper Buttons**: These are used to control the flippers on the pinball table, allowing the player to hit the ball.
- **Plunger**: This is used to launch the ball into play. It can be a physical plunger that mimics the action of a real pinball machine or a digital button.
- **Nudge and Tilt Sensors**: These sensors detect when the player nudges or tilts the machine, which can affect the ball's movement.
- **Start Button**: This button is used to start a new game.
- **Coin Door**: This input simulates the action of inserting coins to play the game.
- **Service Buttons**: These are used for maintenance and configuration of the machine.
- **LED and Light Controls**: These inputs control the various lights and LEDs on the machine, adding to the visual experience.
- **Feedback Devices**: These include solenoids, motors, and other devices that provide tactile feedback to the player, simulating the feel of a real pinball machine.
- **Digital Display**: This shows the score and other game information.
- **Sound System**: This provides the audio effects and music for the game.
- **Accelerometer**: This detects the movement and orientation of the machine.
- **Touchscreen**: Some virtual pinball machines have a touchscreen for additional controls and settings.
- **Motion Sensors**: These can detect the player's movements and gestures for interactive gameplay.
- **Launch Button**: An alternative to the plunger, this button can be used to launch the ball into play.
- **Extra Ball Button**: This button is used to activate an extra ball during gameplay.
- **Magna Save Button**: This button activates a magnetic save feature to prevent the ball from draining.
- **Volume Control**: This allows the player to adjust the sound volume.
- **Pause Button**: This button is used to pause the game.
- **Replay Button**: This button allows the player to replay a game or a specific part of the game.
- **Exit Button**: This button is used to exit the game or return to the main menu.

## Does RetroDECK Support Virtual Pinball?

Currently, RetroDECK does not support Virtual Pinball due to the complexity and variety of inputs and outputs. We hope to achieve some compatibility with VPin hardware in the far future.

First, we will need to implement a Virtual Pinball System to enable running the games.
