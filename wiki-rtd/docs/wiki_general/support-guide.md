# Reporting a Problem & Support

<img src="../../wiki_icons/pixelitos/edit-delete.png" width="75">

## Before you report a Problem

Before you report something, read the following.

### ❗️ Do NOT report issues directly to third‑party developers ❗️  

If you encounter a problem with an component: 

- Emulator
- Client
- Engine
- Port 
- System 
- Game
  
**Inside RetroDECK**, don’t contact the original developers of those components!

**What to do instead**

- Use RetroDECK’s own support channels for any weird behavior.
- If RetroDECK determines the issue comes from a built‑in component, the RetroDECK team will handle communication with the external developers.

Our support is ours, and theirs are theirs! 

## How-to: Reporting an Problem

- The primary issue tracker is **[RetroDECK – GitHub Issues](https://github.com/RetroDECK/RetroDECK/issues)**.  
- We keep it tidy—only “real” bugs belong here.  
- For general guidance, use the socials, wiki, or the broader RetroDECK community.

### The wiki is the single source of truth for all RetroDECK documentation and information.

The RetroDECK team works to propagate useful tips, solutions, and clarifications from Discord or other community venues into the wiki: either as new articles or updates to the FAQ.

### Discord & Matrix

Discord and Matrix are used for more guidance-type issues and community support.

Abide by the rules before asking any questions.

### Is the Problem Already Reported?

- Check the **[RetroDECK – GitHub Issues](https://github.com/RetroDECK/RetroDECK/issues)** page for existing reports.  
- Look at the bug‑reporting channels of the specific emulator/engine/system you’re using; wait for RetroDECK to roll out an update if it’s a known issue.  
- Review the **FAQ ❔** section of this wiki.

### General rule of thumb is:

| Situation | Where to Start |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Discussion, clarification, or a question** | 🤝 **Community‑Support** channel on Discord. The community (and sometimes the RetroDECK team) will respond. |
| **Potentially serious issue, but you lack technical depth** | 🆘 **Support** channel on Discord. The RetroDECK team mainly handles these, with occasional community input. |
| **You’ve identified the issue and possibly a fix** | Submit a detailed report directly on **GitHub**. |
