## About: RetroDECK GitHub Releases

RetroDECK is **NOT** considered **"released"** until it is published on Flathub. 

That is because GitHub releases can on rare occasions break in the publication process between:

`Cooker (GitHub)` -> `Main (GitHub)` -> `Flathub Testing` -> `Flathub`.

The release might need more tweaking and Flathub fixes before the publication happens.

RetroDECK releases only become officially available to everyone only after it is published on Flathub. 

- Always upgrade through Flathub using your distribution's built-in app store.
- Avoid upgrading from GitHub unless you're assisting with testing.
