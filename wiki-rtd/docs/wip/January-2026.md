## Experiment Showcase: Rámon van Raaij's RetroDECK Console

[RetroDECK Console Experiment](https://ramon.vanraaij.eu/from-proxmox-node-to-retro-console-my-arch-linux-retrodeck-journey/)

Rámon conducted an experiment to create a RetroDECK console without a desktop environment, launching directly into RetroDECK.

**Note:** This was done before the 0.10.0b rewrite patch and may no longer be accurate. We still think it's cool tho! Good job Rámon!

*"However, I want to be upfront. If you are starting fresh and just want to play games without the headache, you should probably just look into Batocera."*
*"But, if you are stubborn like me, or you specifically want to run RetroDeck on Arch Linux on older hardware without a full blown Desktop Environment, this guide is for you."*

//Rámon van Raaij
