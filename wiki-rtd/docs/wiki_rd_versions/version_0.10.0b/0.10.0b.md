## ⚠️ Important: Ponzu does not work with RetroDECK 0.10.0b ⚠️

The new layered flatpak system and Ponzu’s temporary solution for installing legacy emulators cannot operate within this new architecture.

We’re shipping two components that cover the most common use‑cases previously handled by Ponzu:

Azahar and Ryubing.

**What you can do:**

- Keep your existing RetroDECK installation if you rely on Ponzu.
- Avoid upgrading to 0.10.0b until you’re ready to move away from Ponzu
- You can always downgrade via Flathub if you need the older version, but this is **Not Recommended**.

## Rewrote Everything from the Ground Up  

Almost **2000+** commits later, the changes are too extensive for line‑by‑line patch notes, so here’s a high‑level overview:

### Core Architecture

<img src="../../../wiki_icons/retrodeck/icon-framework.svg" width="75">


- **Rebuilt component interactions** Completely rebuilt how all components interact within RetroDECK and RetroDECK itself. 
- **Introduced a modular component system**, with each component isolated in its own sub-sandbox.  
- **Upgraded to `org.kde.Platform 6.10`** removing previous passive-aggressive terminal errors.
- **Refactored the `net.retrodeck.retrodeck.yml` configuration file** for improved structure, easier maintenance and made it very pretty.  
- **Reduced default application permissions** Significantly reduced the default permissions granted to the RetroDECK application.
- **Added granular, purpose-driven permission sets** with explicit rationales for each in the `net.retrodeck.retrodeck.yml` (yay transparency!).

---

### RetroDECK Assembler 

<img src="../../../wiki_icons/retrodeck/icon-assembler.svg" width="75">

- **Complete build pipeline overhaul:** Each component is now built independently, and the resulting artifacts are then assembled into the final RetroDECK system.
  
---

### RetroDECK Alchemist & The Component System

<img src="../../../wiki_icons/retrodeck/icon-alchemist.svg" width="75"> 

- **Introduced the RetroDECK Alchemist** to the build pipeline. Each component is now defined and sourced via a `component_recipe` file managed by the RetroDECK Alchemist.
- **Added component ingredient files** that instruct the RetroDECK Framework on the details and requirements of each component.
- **Redesigned library and dependency management**, ensuring that each component retrieves only the resources it requires.
- **In simple terms:** RetroDECK can now integrate almost any Flatpak, AppImage, binary or source built application. Provided the appropriate component files are created. This makes adding new apps much easier and more flexible. **Note:** The RetroDECK team retains final approval over which components are included in RetroDECK.

### RetroDECK API

<img src="../../../wiki_icons/retrodeck/icon-api.svg" width="75">

We’ve introduced a brand‑new RetroDECK API. It powers several core internal functions today, and it’s fully open for external developers to play with.

## New Components

We added some new goodies.

### Added: A new Emulator: XRoar

<img src="../../../wiki_images/logos/xroar-tano64-logo.jpg" width="150">

XRoar is an open‑source emulator that recreates the classic 8‑bit Tandy/Dragon computers. 

<img src="../xroar-balldozer.png" width="250">

It supports tape, disk, and cartridge images, providing a faithful recreation of the original hardware and its peripherals.

- Tandy Color Computer (CoCo) 
- Dragon Data Dragon 32 / 64
- Tano Dragon 



```

Mr.ImCoKeMaN: Gee willikers! RetroDECK Team, this is a mighty fine system! Now I can finally do my taxes on Home Finance (1983), the premier platform for fiscal responsibility!

RetroDECK Team:

We’re glad to hear that you’re enjoying it. And thank you for contributing so many x86-64 ports to PortMaster.

```

### Added: A new Emulator: Azahar

<img src="../../../wiki_images/logos/azahar-logo.svg" width="75">

Azahar is a lightweight, high‑performance emulator for N3DS games.

It will also be the default emulator for N3DS and


```
Mrs. A. User: Gosh darn! RetroDECK Team, will you move the data during the upgrade? Even from those old-timey legacy Citra-Standalone-via-Ponzu folders?

RetroDECK Team:

All data from the Citra-Standalone (via Ponzu) will be migrated. The RetroArch Citra Core data will remain unchanged, as users will still have the option to use it. Nothing will affect this data.  
However, please note that **save states are not compatible** between the old Citra-Standalone (via Ponzu) and Azahar. We strongly recommend using in-game saves only, as we do for all systems.

The current default Citra RetroArch Core will remain available for those who prefer it. The new default, however, will be Azahar.  
To switch back to the Citra core, you will need to select it under Alternative Emulators in ES-DE. 

Additionally, Azahar does not support the **.3ds** format (read more on the wiki link below).
 
```

### Added: A new Emulator: Ryubing

<img src="../../../wiki_images/logos/ryubing-logo.png" width="85">

Ryubing replaces Ryujinx (Legacy).

```
Mr. A. User: Jumpin’ Jehoshaphat! RetroDECK Team, will you move the data from Ryujinx during the upgrade?

RetroDECK Team:

The data structure remains largely the same. Your existing folders should be automatically migrated.
However, a firmware reinstallation will still be required. Make sure you perform in-game saves beforehand.

 
```

### Added: A new Engine: OpenBor


<img src="../../../wiki_images/logos/openbor-logo.svg" width="75">

OpenBOR (Open Beats of Rage) is a flexible 2‑D fighting‑game engine. 

It comes it's own RetroDECK wrapper that handles: `.bor` and `.openbor` files for easier adding of games into RetroDECK (kinda like we are doing with GZDoom).

**Read more:**

[OpenBOR: Guide](../../wiki_engine_guides/openbor/openbor-guide.md)


---


### Added: A new System/Tool: Flips

<img src="../../../wiki_images/logos/flips-logo.png" width="75">

**Flips** (Floating IPS) is a lightweight, patcher that supports both `.ips` and `.bps` formats, allowing users to apply and create ROM hack patches.

You will find Flips inside the RetroDECK Configurator as its own component.

## New Features

### Added: Folder Iconset Support & Lahrs Folder Iconset

<img src="../../../wiki_icons/folder-iconsets/lahrs-main/rd_home.ico" width="75">

Introducing our first-ever Folder Iconset, designed by RetroDECK team member **Lahrs**.

This update also includes handy tools to re-add or remove the iconset (perfect for those who like to keep things minimal and are allergic to icons).  

Plus, we've laid the groundwork for easy future iconset swaps, so the community can contribute new designs down the line.
 

---


### Added: Storage directory

A new `retrodeck/storage` directory serves as a catch‑all location for miscellaneous data we want to expose to users in a more accessible way.  

Only a few items are exposed currently, but we plan to migrate additional data from internal Flatpak locations in upcoming updates.  

**What type of Data are you thinking about?**

- DLC / Patches 
- Download Game Data
- Future DOS emulator – environments for installed: Windows 3.1, 95, 98.
- Assets – quick access to things like FM banks, soundfonts (for U​ZDoom) and DAT files, GameOver screens etc.. (for MAME).  
- Other

## RetroDECK Framework

<img src="../../../wiki_icons/retrodeck/icon-framework.svg" width="75">

**Changes:**

- **Dialogs:** Fully rewritten all pop-up dialogs for greater clarity and usability.  
- **First Install:** Merged the *Add to Steam* and *Add Controller Templates* prompts, since one is unnecessary without the other.

 
**Added:** 

- **First Install:** Improved retrodeck data folder location options that adapt to the device type RetroDECK is being installed on.  
- **First Install:** Introduced a new prompt to enable **Steam Sync** during setup.
- **Steam Sync:** Added Steam Flatpak Version support.
- **Iconset Swaps:** Added a framework for future iconset swaps if the community contributes new sets. 

---

## RetroDECK Configurator

<img src="../../../wiki_icons/retrodeck/icon-configurator.svg" width="75">


**Changes:**

- Overhauled and refined nearly all configurator dialogs to provide a smoother user experience, with added emojis for improved visual clarity.

**Added:** 

-  New tool to **remove** or **re‑add** the iconsset via the configurator.  
-  BIOS Checker comes with additional BIOS/Firmware entries and clearer descriptions.

**Note:**  

Our long-term plan remains to develop a **Godot version of the Configurator**. The new API introduced in this update is a foundational step toward that goal.

--- 

## Components: Emulators / Engines / Systems / Ports / Clients

<img src="../../../wiki_icons/retrodeck/icon-component.svg" width="75">

All components have been updated to a more up to date version:

- All Clients
- All Emulators
- All Multi-Emulators (Retroarch & Cores, MAME, Etc..)
- All Engines 
- All Systems

**The following are the highlighted changes that go beyond a regular update:**

--- 

### ES-DE

<img src="../../../wiki_images/logos/es-de-logo.png" width="75">

We only list the RetroDECK specific changes here, check the full: [ES-DE: Changelog](https://gitlab.com/es-de/emulationstation-de/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

**Changes:** 

- Several folders have been hidden because they aren't supported in RetroDECK (e.g., `Lutris`, `Epic`, `Windows`, and others) to avoid confusion.  
- The `Desktop` folder remains available for various community tinkering experiments.

**Added:** 

- In `es_find_rules.xml`, the `<emulator name="FLATPAKSPAWN">` has been added, making it easier for users who want to tinker with RetroDECK and break out of the sandbox.
- The RetroDECK Theme has been updated with all the new features of ES-DE 3.4.0 such as Played Time.

**Fixed:** 

- A number of alternative emulators that were mistakenly displayed, though unavailable in RetroDECK have now been hidden.

**Known Issues:** 

- The **ES‑DE Configurations** submenu in RetroDECK's ES‑DE does not yet support translations.
- The **ES‑DE: Game Importer** function (e.g., importing Steam games and such) does not work with RetroDECK and has been disabled.

--- 

### GZDoom:

<img src="../../../wiki_images/logos/gzdoom-logo.png" width="75">

**Note:** 

The RetroDECK team had planned to update to **UZDoom**. However, the UZDoom team is still in the process of integrating their own Flatpak into their build pipeline. We have offered our assistance to them if needed.  

For this update, we will continue using **GZDoom**.

**Added:**

**Enhanced .doom file:**

  - Now allows spaces in sourced WAD names.
  - Enables mod‑specific `.ini` files. 
  - Supports symbolic‑linked files.

**New IWADs in the RetroDECK wrapper list**

```
ACTION2.WAD       # Action Doom 2: Urban Brawl
BLASPHEM.WAD      # Blasphemer
DELAWEARE.WAD     # Delaweare
HARM1.WAD         # Harmony
ROTWB.WAD         # Rise Of The Wool Ball
SQUARE1.PK3       # The Adventures of Square
```

The wrapper now provides full support for all files listed here and more:

- [DOOMWiki: IWAD](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/IWAD)

### RetroArch

<img src="../../../wiki_images/logos/retroarch-logo.png" width="75">


**Fixed**

- Added a custom Gambatte override that disables the palette swapping bug on quit once and for all. 

**Added:**

- Additional hard-to-find texture pack folders are now available in `retrodeck/texture_packs`: **Read more:** [RetroArch: Texture Packs](../../wiki_emulator_guides/retroarch/retroarch-texture-pack.md)



---

### SRM (Steam Sync)

<img src="../../../wiki_images/logos/srm-logo.png" width="75">

**Added:**

**Introduced support for Flatpak Steam**

Users must still manually adjust Steam’s permissions. Either through Flatseal or via the command line for full functionality.

### PortMaster

<img src="../../../wiki_images/logos/portmaster-logo.png" width="75">

**Changes:** 

- Game Data Folder is now in the new storage folder: `retrodeck/storage/PortMaster/ports/`

```
RetroDECK Team:

We would like to extend our sincere thanks to Captain Klops and the entire PortMaster team for their efforts in adapting their PortMaster to our new system architecture.

```

---



### Cemu

<img src="../../../wiki_images/logos/cemu-logo.png" width="75">

**Fixed**

- The intended BIOS path `retrodeck/bios/cemu/` should now function as expected.
 
**Added:**

- Exposed `Cemu/graphicPacks` to `retrodeck/texture_packs/Cemu/graphicPacks/` for direct access to textures.

---

## Other Changes

<img src="../../../wiki_icons/pixelitos/accessories-notes.png" width="75">

- **Too many updates to list** - There have been countless changes and bug fixes. 
 

```
RetroDECK Team:

We would like to thank the community for their patience while we built this completely revamped RetroDECK.  
The best part? You'll hardly notice the changes!  
Under the hood, however, we've created something truly unique.
```
