# Flight Controllers

Flight Controllers are used for playing games where you fly airplanes or other things like magic carpets. Some may lack Linux drivers or udev rules, but there are community efforts to make them work. Some require Windows-only software to configure inputs and buttons.

The best solution is to try your Flight Controller on Linux via the Steam Deck Dock or a Linux PC. If it works and supports xinput, it should work with RetroDECK.

If you have a Flight Controller that didn't work on Linux but found a way to make it work:

- Contribute udev rules to the [game-devices-udev codeberg](https://codeberg.org/fabiscafe/game-devices-udev).

**Always check for Linux Support**: Ensure there is Linux support before purchasing.
