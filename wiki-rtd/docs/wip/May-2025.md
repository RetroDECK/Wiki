## MORE! RetroDECK Experiments ‚öóÔ∏è on the Wiki

Our goal with the experiments section on the wiki, added back in March, is to gather various community tinker experiments into one place.

These projects are often scattered across forums, social media, Reddit/Lemmy, and other platforms, making them hard to find. By consolidating this information on the wiki, we can share it with more people from a single source.

The RetroDECK Team is thrilled to document, expand, and showcase your innovative efforts. We love seeing what you can achieve when you think outside the box and experiment.

Now, let's present the experiments so far!

### Disclaimer on Experiments

These experiments are created by the RetroDECK Team and/or Community. The guides are intended for people with technical knowledge and a passion for tinkering. Using these guides might put RetroDECK and your data at risk. The RetroDECK Team can't provide any support for these experiments or fix any issues they might cause on your system or RetroDECK installation.

## Experiment: Autoboot into RetroDECK and not Game Mode

This experiment was initiated by the user Daeymon, then later expanded upon by the RetroDECK Team. Daeymon goal was to explore the possibility of autobooting into RetroDECK when the Steam Deck's Game Mode is launched directly and not into the Steam Game Mode UI.

## Experiment: RetroDECK ES-DE Background Music

This experiment was initiated by the users **Partack** and **TopHatCat**, then later expanded upon by the RetroDECK Team. The goal was to explore the possibility of doing custom scripts to enable very basic music playback in ES-DE.

## Experiment: Launching Games & Apps with RetroDECK

## Experiment: Launching External Emulators

This experiment was initiated by the user **TopHatCat** and later expanded upon by the RetroDECK Team. TopHatCats goal was to explore the possibility of launching games against external Emulators from within RetroDECK (limited to the systems ES-DE supports).

**However, doing this defeats the entire purpose of RetroDECK!** 

Essentially, you are creating an Anti-RetroDECK / Bizzaro-RetroDECK / Absolute Heresy inside of RetroDECK.

## Experiment: Run RetroDECK in WSL on Windows 11

This experiment was initiated by a spontaneous idea from the RetroDECK Team. (Someone on the team was on a mandatory lunch break at work and decided to do something to pass the time after quickly gobbling up their sandwich).

**Note:** RetroDECK was never intended to be used in this manner and the performance is horrible and it is very stupid (don't do this).
