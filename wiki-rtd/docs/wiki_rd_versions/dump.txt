            <ul>
               <li>Fixed a bug where new symlinks were not created correctly and users couldn't scrape their games</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Known Issues:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>PCSX2: due to its limitation, the standalone PCSX2 doesn't have any way to set the hotkeys, so no save and load state, no quit button. In order to quit press: STEAM -&gt; PCSX2 -&gt; (X) CLOSE WINDOW, be aware that the state is not automatically saved</li>
               <li>Due to a Steam limitation, external controllers and keyboard seems not to be working, expecially in the desktop mode</li>
            </ul>
            IMPORTANT NOTE:
        At the moment the emulator configs are reset during every update, this was made because every version they may bring new configurations, please back them up if you did some manual configs.
