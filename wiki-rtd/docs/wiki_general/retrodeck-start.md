## Step 0: Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- A device to install RetroDECK on.
- Related BIOS & Firmware ready.
- Game backups of various formats or purchased titles ready to play.

## Step 1: Installation & Configuration

**Steam Deck - Installation**

Most of the initial setup needs to be done in Desktop Mode.

Follow the guide: [Steam Deck - Installation and Updates](../wiki_devices/steamdeck/steamdeck-start.md)

**Linux Desktop - Installation**

Follow the guide: [Linux Desktop - Installation and Updates](../wiki_devices/linux_desktop/linux-install.md)

## Step 2: Place BIOS & Firmware

Read up on: [Manage your BIOS/Firmware](../wiki_management/bios-firmware.md)

Place BIOS & Firmware files in the `~/retrodeck/bios/` directory.

## Step 3: Place ROMs and Games

RetroDECK follows the ES-DE ROM folder structure.

Place ROM files in their corresponding system directory inside the roms folder. The location of the `retrodeck/roms/` folder depends on your installation location choice.

**Example:**

You have an example NES game called: `ExampleNESGame.nes`

Place `ExampleNESGame.nes` in the `/retrodeck/roms/nes` folder.

## Step 4: Read the ES-DE Frontend Guide

Read up on: [ES-DE Frontend: General Guide](../wiki_system_guides/es-de/esde-guide.md)

## Step 5: Playing the Games

Launch RetroDECK via Steam or by itself. The systems you placed ROM files for should be shown and playable.

**Example:**

The NES category should now be shown in the ES-DE Frontend with `ExampleNESGame.nes` from `Step 3`.
