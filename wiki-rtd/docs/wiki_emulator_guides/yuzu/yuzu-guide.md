**Note:** 

Yuzu was a Switch emulator and was removed as part of the `0.8.0b` update.

It can still be temporarily installed via:

[Ponzu](../../wiki_configurator/ponzu.md)

## Where to put the games?

Switch games should be put into the `retrodeck/roms/switch/` directory.

## What file formats are supported?

```
.xci
.nsp
.nca
.nso
.nro
```

## Does Yuzu require BIOS or Firmware?

Yes, `prod.keys` `title.keys` and `.nca` files.

### Where to put the firmware files?

Needs the key files `prod.keys`, `title.keys` and the firmware files in the following directories:

**Keys:** `~/retrodeck/bios/switch/keys`

**Firmware:** `~/retrodeck/bios/switch/registered`

The directory tree should look like this example:

```
~/retrodeck/bios/switch
├── keys
│   ├── prod.keys
│   └── title.keys
└── registered
    └── XXX amount of .nca files goes here
```
