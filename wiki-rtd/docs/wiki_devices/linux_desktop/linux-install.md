## Game Mode on Your Linux PC?

You can utilize Steam Deck's Game Mode on your Linux PC if your distribution supports it and specific hardware requirements apply for Game Mode to work. 

It mitigates several issues with Steam Input and provides the best RetroDECK experience and playing Steam games with controllers out of the box.

Here is a list of some distributions that support Game Mode:
