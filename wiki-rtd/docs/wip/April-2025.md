## AI Powered Gameplay Assist and Voice Reaction

Looking for a blast from the past to escape the modern world? We've got you covered!

Introducing the next big thing for RetroDECK:

**AI Powered Gameplay Assist and Voice Reaction**

Connect RetroDECK to your favorite AI solutions, whether local or cloud-based.

Choose from our built-in character profiles that will talk to you, assist you, and comment on your gameplay, no matter what game you're playing.

The future is now!

### Character Profiles

Here's a sneak peek at some of the characters we will offer:

---

#### Raid Leader

The Raid Leader is here to make sure you never feel good about your gameplay. Expect quick, passive-aggressive comments and constant reminders that you're not perfect. Just like a real Raid Leader!

**When you are playing:**

- The Raid Leader will constantly remind you that you're playing at a below-shit-tier level, no matter what you play or how you play.
- The Raid Leader will inform you that the only way to get better is to quit your job, class, family, and friends and dedicate your entire life to the game.
- Each time you make the slightest misstep, the Raid Leader will go into `rage mode`, cussing at you and reducing your DKP by at least 50 points (that's a lot of points).

#### Drunk Hunter

The Drunk Hunter only communicates in semi-drunken grunts, hisses, random words, sounds of pouring glasses, opening cans, and keyboard noises. The Drunk Hunter will assist your gameplay like an auto player or aimbot, playing at your game at a scaling level.

**When you are playing:**

- **Level 1**: The assist starts slow, playing at an average level until about `1.30 hours` in. You will hear the sounds of cans opening and glasses being poured.
- **Level 2**: Between `1.31 hours` to `2.30 hours`, you will have perfect gameplay with the sound of the Drunk Hunter rolling their head all over the keyboard for maximum DPS.
- **Level 3**: Post the `2.31 hours` mark, the AI assist will collapse and keep failing the slightest tasks accompanied by:
    - The sounds of random drunk noises.
    - Drunk mentioning of something called Aimed Shot.
    - The sounds of dropping things on the floor and broken glass.

#### Bigger Sibling

The Bigger Sibling will join you in multiplayer games as the second player.

**When you are playing:**

The Bigger Sibling operates under special guidelines.

**If you are playing a PVP game:**

- The Bigger Sibling will always pick the most cheesy and broken character.
- If the most cheesy and broken character is taken by you, they will call your parents.

**If you are playing a CO-OP game:**

- The Bigger Sibling will always pick the most cheesy and broken character if there is one.
- If there is some cooperative puzzle like grabbing you and taking you over an edge, the sibling will always drop you two to five times first on purpose with an annoying laughter.
- If you are in an obstacle course and need to jump over pits, the Bigger Sibling will auto adapt and try to block your path so you fall into the pit about 50% of the time.
    - If you are blocking your sibling and pushing them into pits, they will call your parents.

**What happens if the parents are called?**

- If the parents are called, they will ask you both to go to your room and RetroDECK will shut down automatically and abruptly, all progress will be lost.

#### COD 360 Lobby Gamer

The COD 360 Lobby Gamer brings you all the best experiences from early online console gaming.

**When you are playing:**

The COD 360 Lobby Gamer will:

- Spend most of the time screaming loudly.
- Will suck at games you throw at it.
- When confronted, will talk about all the depraved things they will do to your mom.

---


#### The Ghost of Mourning

The Ghost of Mourning offers sudden whispers of ghostly haunting greeting phrases not related to your gameplay before going silent again. 

This AI character simulates the feeling of the dread, loss and loneliness of the player that still is always looking and yearning endlessly in vein for his long dead guild/clan/group/team have ceased to exist over a more then a decade ago.

The person that:

- Keeps logging in everyday to the game itself.
- Keeps logging in everyday to the old empty communication server (Ventrilo, TeamSpeak, Mumble, etc..).

Stuck in forever in a endless perpetual login torment.

**When you are playing:** 

As you are playing, in certain days you will see hear an simulated social login sound and have different people make ghostly whispers to you:

- "Hey, are you playing?!" 
- "Hey, long time no see" 
- "Wow this place is totally empty!"
- "Good to you again!"
- "I got `purples / diamonds / kill streak` last night!"
- "Do you remember when we did this the `raid / tournament / build / match` together, those where the days"

Before you can even say a word back... the disconnect sound is played and it is once again silent for days.

### The Ghost of Mourning: Trauma Center

As The Ghost of Mourning is the most traumatizing of all characters. 

The RetroDECK Team have created a `🏥-trauma-center` channel on the Discord that will be populated by a vast network community none-experts for it to be a place where people can talk about their long lost `Guild/Clan/Group/Team`. 

**One user**: 

```

I still see her everytime I login right there in my friends list on Steam. 

Been offline for 13 years, my brain tells me... I need to remove this dead account. 

But everytime I move the cursor... I just can't... I need that avatar still in my life. 

PEELS HERE!! FOREVER... OMEGAKILLER9999.

```

**Another**: 

```

We where building blocks, I was making a train station and TheDuckMan0910 was making a stupid statue in the middle of the road, blocking everything in sight and polluting the landscape, like an eyesore. 

But the TheDuckMan0910 never returned. 

His stupid statue still stands in the middle of the landscape never to be touched but as a monument to all the diamonds we got in the end. 

I still miss that stupid man of a duck...

```

**Another One**: 

```

"WHERE THE BOYS AT?!...

The boys?... 

Boys?... 

:(

```
