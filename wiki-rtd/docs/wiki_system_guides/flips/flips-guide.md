## What are ROM Hacks?

A **ROM Hack** is a fan-made modification of a game’s original ROM file that changes or adds content. 

Some ROM Hacks can be **combined**, allowing multiple hacks to be applied to the same game for a merged or enhanced experience.  

### Common Types

- **Bug fixes & quality-of-life improvements** – fixing issues or adding small conveniences.  
- **Difficulty adjustments** – making the game harder or easier.  
- **Enhancement patches** – improving visuals, performance, or controls.  
- **Gameplay overhauls** – changing core mechanics or abilities.  
- **Graphic or audio changes** – updating sprites, music, or themes.  
- **New levels or worlds** – adding new stages or maps.  
- **Remixes** – reworking existing levels or mechanics.  
- **Total conversions** – transforming the game into something entirely new.  
- **Totally new games & story** – creating a brand-new narrative and experience.  
- **Translation patches** – adding new language translations.
