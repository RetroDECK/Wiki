## Many new users - Thanks!

We are in our small team very are humble and happy for the recent uptick of RetroDECK users.

Come join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/Dz3szYsP8g) and say Hi!

Or just read up on the [Wiki](https://retrodeck.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (we are updating it almost every day with new information).

We are glad to have you!

## Cooperation between projects: Vita3K

Parts of the RetroDECK team have been talking to the Vita3K team about hotkey improvements and giving advice (and memes) about building a flatpak.

We are hopeful that these discussions leads to improvements for both projects (and maybe a flatpak version of Vita3K in the future).

## Cooperation between projects: BoilR

Another person we have been in contact with recently is the developer of BoilR as we working on integrating it into RetroDECK for the "Add RetroDECK games as separate entries in Steam".

A new release of BoilR will be made with our recommended additions that will also benefit those that just use the BoilR application. But we will let the BoilR developer unveil those features.

##  Status Update: Games as separate entries in Steam

This function already works in our Beta testing. <br>
There are some minor fixes left, but it works as intended thanks to the above cooperation.

This first version of the function is simple but also quite elegant:

**In the Configurator:**

**Configure Steam GridDB**
- Put in your SteamGridDB API Key from your account.
- Checkbox if you want to use NSFW and/or Animated Art.

**Do the thing**
- You press the "Sync Favorites" button.

All games you have marked as favorites in ES-DE interface are then synced, scraped and added to Steam as separate games.

As the RetroDECK Controller Profile is a global profile you will need to reselect it for each entry (as they are counted as a new game in Steam).

We hope to develop this function more in the future but this will be the first iteration of it.

## Status Update: MAME

We have manged to build MAME, we still have several tests to be done and configurations to do.


## Status Update: Godot Configurator

The Godot Configurator still a work progresses.

It have gotten many major overhauls and improvements.

We are also working on translation files and we hope to have some language options:

- English (got it right now)

But also:

- Swedish
- Italian
- Japanese
- Chinese (Simplified)
- Ukrainian

Later we will have the option for the community to send their translations via pull requests and create a little translation group on the Discord.


### The font problem

One roadblock is the font.

The current font we are we are using is not supporting all characters needed for the above languages.

It is very hard to find a better retro inspired open font

Another good thing would be if we can accommodate people dyslexia similar to https://opendyslexic.org/ but retro inspired.

If you have any experience with font development or godot development and want to help out, please join the Discord and post the 💙-i-want-to-help channel
