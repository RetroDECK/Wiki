## Will you implement X/Y/Z system?

Our goal is to implement and configure the best version, for each system supported by ES-DE. 

If your favorite system is not integrated, you can request its integration by opening an issue on GitHub. 

There are already several suggestions:

[RetroDECK Github - New Components](https://github.com/RetroDECK/RetroDECK/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22New%20Component%20%F0%9F%92%BE%22)

## I have an innovative idea on a new feature, how do I suggest it?

Check if the request already exists in the issue list on GitHub. 

If not, you can create a new issue and suggest it. 

You can also discuss your ideas in our community before submitting.

## Will you add Windows versions of the emulators and run them via Wine/Proton?

Currently, there are no plans to support this.

## Will you implement Cloud Sync/Backup?

Yes, that is planned for a future update. We will allow users to use their own services via easy built-in tools in the Configurator.

### What can I use now while waiting for Cloud Sync/Backup?

Here are some open-source options:

- [Rsync](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync)

- [NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com/)

- [Syncthing](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing)

- [Syncthing GTK GUI](https://flathub.org/apps/me.kozec.syncthingtk)
