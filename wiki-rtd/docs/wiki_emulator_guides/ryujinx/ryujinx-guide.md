<img src="../../../wiki_images/logos/ryujinx-logo.svg" width="75">

Ryujinx was a Switch emulator. 

**Note: Legacy Emulator**

As of RetroDECK `0.9.0b` Ryujinx is marked as Legacy and has stopped it's development.

It also does not work a 100% as it should as the update that where supposed to fix symlink issues never materialized. 

## Where to put the games?

Switch games should be put into the `retrodeck/roms/switch/` directory.

## What file formats are supported?

| File Format | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| .xci        | Nintendo Switch Cartridge Image |
| .nsp        | Nintendo Submission Package **(Recommended)** |
| .nca        | Nintendo Content Archive |
| .nso        | Nintendo Switch Executable |
| .nro        | Nintendo Switch Homebrew |


## Does Ryujinx require BIOS or Firmware?

Yes, `prod.keys` `title.keys` and `.nca` files.

**Notice: Do not mix and match versions firmware and keys**

The installed firmware must have have the same version at your keys and .nca files, you can't mix and match as that can lead to crashes and black screens!

You need to make sure that the keys and firmware are from the same version.

Generally do not install the firmware from games. Instead provide your own firmware and keys from your own device.

### Where to put the key files?

**Keys:** 

`~/retrodeck/bios/switch/keys`

`~/.var/app/net.retrodeck.retrodeck/config/Ryujinx/system/`


### How-to: Install the firmware
