<img src="../../../wiki_images/logos/rd-logo-box.png" width="600">

**Release Date:** 2022-05-02

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

At the moment the emulator configs are reset during every update, this was made because every version may bring new configurations, please back them up if you did some manual configs.

**Emulators:**
            
- Yuzu was broken: fixed
- Dolphin-libretro is now the default emulator as Dolphin (Standalone) seems to be broken
            
**New Standalone emulators:**
            
- RPCS3
- PPSSPP
- CITRA
- MelonDS
- PICO-8
            
**Tools:**
            
- Added tools to start each standalone emulator
- Added a tool to start PICO-8's SPLORE
- Fixed the Move ROMs tool (probably)
            
**ES-DE Frontend:**
            
- Updated ES-DE to 1.2.4 and redirected to the new repo
- Updated Art-Book theme to fix the mising images for n3ds and pico-8
- Now The quit button is showing "Quit RetroDECK"
- Added RetroDECK version in the ES-DE main menu
            
**Backend**:
            
- Wrapper complete rewrite, now it's faster, tidier, solid
- Wrapper: user data is now backup and moved when managing the internal folders
- Introduced versioning: now the version is visible by CLI or in the options menu
- Rewrote cooker.yml workflow as the old one was no more useful for the scope
- Removed the bios/bios folder that in some situations is mistakenly created
- Logs are now into ~/retrodeck/.logs however they must be improved
- Moved the scraped data folder into ~/retrodeck/.downloaded_data for backup purposes and to avoid data loss when resetting RetroDECK
- Moved themes folder in ~/retrodeck/.downloaded_data, same as above
- Updated es_find_rules.xml
- Updated es_systems.xml: some default emulators are changed, if you cannot load the game is maybe because of that, you can still choose the former emulator from the list
- Added post-install scripts, now deleting ~/retrodeck/.log or ~/.var/app/net.retrodeck.retrodeck is no more needed (hopefully)
- Added CLI arguments, run flatpak run net.retrodeck.retrodeck -h for more info
- Added a CLI option to reset RetroDECK --reset
- Replaced Kdialog with Zenity
- Added manifest: this should fix the Discover bug
            
**Known Issues:**
            
- Controller is not configured for most of the standalone emulators, I will configure them when I will get my Steam Deck (ETA mid June)
- External controllers seems not to be working
- Yuzu makes RetroDECK freeze in some situations, like if the rom is a bad dump
