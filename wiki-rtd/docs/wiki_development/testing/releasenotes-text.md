## About: RetroDECK GitHub Releases

RetroDECK is **NOT** considered **"released"** until it is published on Flathub. 

That is because GitHub releases can on rare occasions break in the publication process between:

`Cooker (GitHub)` ->  `Main (GitHub) RC` -> `Main (GitHub) Master` -> `Flathub Testing` -> `Flathub (Stable)`.

The release might need more tweaking and Flathub fixes before the publication happens.

RetroDECK releases only become officially available to everyone only after it is published on Flathub. 

- Always upgrade through Flathub using your distribution's built-in app store.
- Avoid upgrading from GitHub unless you're assisting with testing.

 **Note**

 The `org.kde.Platform` runtime has been upgraded. Depending on your system configuration, you may need to manually install version **6.10** to use Release Candidate (RC) builds:

```
 flatpak install org.kde.Platform
```

Once the stable is published on Flathub, this installation step will be handled automatically via Flathub.
