## Component Sub-Sandboxing 



## KDE Framework -> Freedesktop

## RetroDECK Assembler

## RetroDECK API

In RetroDECK 0.10.0b we are introducing the RetroDECK API.

It enables external applications to access information and perform actions through the RetroDECK Framework, allowing them to function as the RetroDECK Configurator.

Currently, the API is accessible only via named pipes or internally within the RetroDECK Framework. 

Additional communication methods may be introduced in the future.

## Summertime ‚òÄÔ∏è 

Many on the RetroDECK Team have IRL things happening during the summer period: 

- Vacation 
- Home improvements
- Kids / Family
- Etc..

Thus there will be no blog-post in July.

The team might also be less active on various social channels. 

### That is all for now 

There are more things we are working on, but you will see them in future blog updates!

And as always if you want to help with development join the üíô-i-want-to-help channel on Discord.

Thanks everyone!
