## MORE! RetroDECK Experiments ‚öóÔ∏è on the Wiki

<img src="../../../icon-rd.svg" width="75"> 

Back in March, we added an "RetroDECK Experiments" section to the wiki to collect and organize community tinker projects in one spot.

These projects are often scattered across various platforms (thus making them hard to find):

- Forums
- Social media 
- Reddit / Lemmy 
- Discord / Revolt 
- Other

By centralizing them on the wiki, we aim to make them easily accessible to more people.

The RetroDECK Team is excited to showcase your creativity and document your innovative experiments. We even created a Community Tinker Team‚Äîcomposed of the experiment creators‚Äîto help share ideas and spark inspiration.

Now, let's present the experiments so far!

### Disclaimer on Experiments

These experiments are created by the RetroDECK Team and/or Community. The guides are intended for people with technical knowledge and a passion for tinkering. Using these guides might put RetroDECK and your data at risk. The RetroDECK Team can't provide any support for these experiments or fix any issues they might cause on your system or RetroDECK installation.

## Experiment: Autoboot into RetroDECK and not Game Mode

<img src="../../../wiki_icons/pixelitos/preferences-system-splash.png" width="50">

This experiment was initiated by the user Daeymon, then later expanded upon by the RetroDECK Team. Daeymon goal was to explore the possibility of autobooting into RetroDECK when the Steam Deck's Game Mode is launched directly and not into the Steam Game Mode UI.

## Experiment: RetroDECK ES-DE Background Music

<img src="../../../wiki_icons/pixelitos/applications-multimedia.png" width="50">

This experiment was initiated by the users **Partack** and **TopHatCat**, then later expanded upon by the RetroDECK Team. The goal was to explore the possibility of doing custom scripts to enable very basic music playback in ES-DE.

## Experiment: Launching Games & Apps with RetroDECK

This experiment was initiated by the users **murkl** and **Daeymon**.

We already featured in back in March blog in a limited way but more guides have been added and expanded upon since then. 

### Flatpak Games & Apps

### Minecraft Instances

### Heroic Games & Apps

## Experiment: Launching External Emulators

<img src="../../../wiki_images/logos/dolphin-logo.png" width="50">

This experiment was initiated by the user **TopHatCat** and later expanded upon by the RetroDECK Team. TopHatCats goal was to explore the possibility of launching games against external Emulators from within RetroDECK (limited to the systems ES-DE supports).

**However, doing this defeats the entire purpose of RetroDECK!** 

Essentially, you are creating an Anti-RetroDECK / Bizzaro-RetroDECK / Absolute Heresy inside of RetroDECK.

## Experiment: Run RetroDECK in WSL on Windows 11

<img src="../../../wiki_icons/pixelitos/windows.png" width="50">

This experiment was initiated by a spontaneous idea from the RetroDECK Team (someone on the team was on a mandatory lunch break at work and decided to do something to pass the time after quickly gobbling up their sandwich).

**Note:** RetroDECK was never intended to be used in this manner and the performance is horrible and it is very stupid (don't do this).
