## Where to put the games?
Switch games should be put into the `retrodeck/roms/switch/` directory.<br>
The games can come in many different formats: `XCI` `NSP` `NCA` `NSO` `NRO`.

## Open Ryujinx

`RetroDECK Configurator` ->  `Open Emulator` -> `Ryujinx`

## Does Ryujinx require BIOS or Firmware?

Needs the key files `prod.keys`, `title.keys` and the firmware files in the following directories:

**Keys:** `~/retrodeck/bios/switch/keys`

**Firmware:** `~/retrodeck/bios/switch/registered`

The directory tree should look like this example:
```
~/retrodeck/bios/switch
├── keys
│   ├── prod.keys
│   └── title.keys
└── registered
    └── XXX amount of .nca files goes here
```

It also have installation requirements

### How-to: Install the firmware

Ryujinx also requires the firmware to be installed via `RetroDECK Configurator` ->  `Open Emulator` -> `Ryujinx` ->  `Tools` -> `Install Firmware` -> `Install from XCI or ZIP`

### Notice: Do not mix and match versions firmware and keys

The installed firmware must have have the same version at your keys and .nca files, you can't mix and match as that can lead to crashes and black screens!

You need to make sure that the keys and firmware are from the same version.

Generally do not install the firmware from games. Instead provide your own firmware and keys from your own device.
