### Information

This a minor update with PPSSPP fixes

**Note:**
If you have logged in to RetroAchivements on PPSSPP you might need to do so again.

## Updates

- PPSSPP

**No other updates??!**

Yes, we are going to release a 0.7.7b "soonish"" with the rest of the emulator updates.
We are just waiting for a upstream fix in a certain emulator before we ship it (we have submitted the commit).

## New Features: Controller and Hotkey improvements

### PPSSPP

- The press `Escape` to `Open Menu` bind have been removed.
- Many of the standard combos and radial buttons now work

The upstream bug of combo hotkeys in the flatpak PPSSPP is now fixed.
You no longer need to press `Escape` button bind / radial button to `Open Menu`.

Thanks to this fix, everything is now mapped as it should in uniformity with the other emulators where possible.
The following binds are available:

- Quit Emulator
- Open Menu
- Save State
- Load State
- Previous / Next State
- Fastforward
- Rewind
- Rapid Fire Toggle
- Speed Toggle
- Record Video
- Fullscreen Toggle
- Emulator Screenshot

## Bugfixes & other changes

- ADDED: More Easter Egg Boot logos for some Holidays (we won't spoil them)
- PIPELINE: Refactor and automation improvements for easier local development.
