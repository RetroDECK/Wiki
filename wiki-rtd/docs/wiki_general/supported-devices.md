RetroDECK was built for the Steam Deck in mind and started as a project towards that device.

## Linux Desktop

RetroDECK works on Linux desktops but relies on Steam Input for advanced hotkeys. For the best experience, use a distribution with built-in Game Mode like SteamOS, Bazzite, or ChimeraOS and more.


## Other x86_64 Linux Handhelds / Devices

Our community is highly creative and likes putting RetroDECK on new devices.

RetroDECK can work on various devices emulating PlayStation, Steam Deck, or Xbox controllers in Steam Input. If a device has custom inputs, contact the RetroDECK Team to help us create a Steam Input profile.

### Installing Linux & RetroDECK on x86_64 Windows Handelds

## FAQ Devices / OS

### Will you support Windows?

No, RetroDECK doesn't support Windows currently. 

You can try [RetroBat](https://www.retrobat.org/) for similar functionality on Windows.

Alternatively, you can install a Linux distribution on your device to use RetroDECK. Supporting Windows would be a major undertaking and would require more developers with Windows experience.

### Will you support ARM devices like iOS, MacOS and Android?

No, RetroDECK doesn't support ARM devices currently. 

The underlying systems would need to be rewritten due to different emulators and licensing models,
especially on Android where some emulators are open source on x86_64 but closed source on ARM.

Supporting ARM devices would be a major undertaking and would require more developers with ARM experience.

### Will you support RISC-V?

The idea of supporting RISC-V is exciting, but it as everything else would be a major undertaking.

It might be possible in the far-off future as the platform matures and gains more compatibility.

But supporting RISC-V devices would be a major undertaking and would require more developers with RISC-V experience.

### Will you support other Linux distribution methods such as Snap or AppImage?

It's not in our roadmap yet. Currently, the entire build system is based on flatpak-build. 

The team is not large enough to migrate and maintain other distribution methods. 

However, if someone with knowledge and passion wishes to help with migrating and maintaining it, we are open to discussion.
