<img src="../../wiki_icons/retrodeck/icon-rd.svg" width="100">

What follows is a list of features and software currently included in RetroDECK.


### Note: RetroDECK does not include any games, proprietary BIOS or Firmware

The user needs to provide their own purchased backups / game files to play.

The user needs to provide their own purchased BIOS / Firmware files from their own consoles or purchased engines files (for example Pico-8) for the systems that needs them.

## The RetroDECK Framework

RetroDECK adds the `RetroDECK Framework` on top of the software that allows deeper integrations between the built-in software and easier exposure to a variety of features that you otherwise need to set for example per emulator basis to create a uniformity between them.

## The RetroDECK Configurator

<img src="../../wiki_icons/retrodeck/icon-configurator.svg" width="100">

Is a powerful Utility that can be used to change/modify and manipulate various aspects of RetroDECK.

The `RetroDECK Configurator` is the `Utility` that exposes some parts of the `RetroDECK Framework` to the RetroDECK users.

**What can the RetroDECK Framework and by extent the RetroDECK Configurator do?**

It can help with:

- Compressing games
- Easier `Texture Pack` and `Mod` management
- File management
- Tools for troubleshooting (BIOS Checker, Multi-File Structure Checker, Partial or full reset of functions)
- Auto installing some free BIOSes
- Install prebuilt Steam Input profiles for devices like the Steam Deck and external controllers
- Easier management of `mods`, `roms`, `texture_packs`, `scraped media`, `screenshots`, `saves / states` `gamelists` and more
- Give access to global presets that can be acitivated to configure things over many emulators in one go like: `RetroAchievements`
  `Borders` `Widescreen Mode` `Swaping A/B X/Y for Nintendo Games`
- And more!

## Missing Features and BETA Period

We plan to add more emulators, engines, systems, and functions over the course of the development cycle.

We do not have any plans to ship all emulators, engines, or systems in existence for each game system or console. The goal is to ship those that handle that system the best with the most features and we are allowed to ship.
