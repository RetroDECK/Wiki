## The bad news - Moving Godot Configurator

We are also postponing the release of the Godot Configurator to a later major version to incorporate valuable feedback from both our team members and community testers. 

As we already delayed 0.9.0b long enough, we decided to move the Godot Configurator to a future version.

We really want to get the next major update out the the public!

## The good news - 0.9.0 Captain Comeback soon

The good news is then that 0.9.0b is coming very very soon.

We are in fact in the final stages of testing with the community testers.

We are squashing minor bugs and tweaking some small things based on feedback.

If you want to help out the testing effort go to the ðŸ’™-i-want-to-help channel on Discord.

## We have updated the wiki with new content

If you are an avid visitor to the wiki you might have noticed we have restructured some things and added more information in various articles. 

But even more important we have added all the new guides for 0.9.0b!
