## Thanks Lx32 and dottormac

We want to give a special thanks to our former RetroDECK Team members Lx32 & dottormac. 

Both of them made contributions to RetroDECK over it's lifespan. Sometimes things in-real-life takes away your time to contribute to a open source project. 

- dottormac helped a lot of with early testing of RetroDECK.
- Lx32 focused on the SRM implemention (but started with BoilR back in the day) for adding games to Steam. 

They have both graduated to RetroDECK Alumni and have a special role on Discord.
Us in the rest of the Team wishes them happy journey going forward. 

Keep in touch you two! 🤌🍕🍝🍌🤌 ❤️
