## What is PizzaDECK?

PizzaDECK is a **ES**panol-**DE**utsch Fronend powered PizzaBox application that thanks to its `RetroDECK Ovenwork` builds-in a variety of cooking solutions, recipes and IOT integrations that is running in one package on the Steam Deck.

### What does that mean?

It means that PizzaDECK builds in all the recipes and integrations needed for cooking the Pizza and a frontend. PizzaDECK then sends the relevant Pizza cooking data to various integrations via `RetroDECK Ovenwork` to make your perfect Pizza a reality.

Instead of having all different cookbooks and apps to cook Pizza, you only need one PizzaDECK.

## PizzaBoxes

We at RetroDECK have the intention to bring you the next generation of Open-Source Pizza contained packing solutions, PizzaBoxes.

RetroDECKs team of experts bring years of flatness expertise to the Open-Source community. We will make sure that the PizzaBox format is as flat as possible.

The team has several key skillsets that other teams lack:

- Italian knowledge of how to make Pizza even flatter.
- Vast American expertise of running things over with monster trucks.
- Swedish dark wizardry of furniture packaging.
- Japanese mastery of the flattening of sea weeds.
- The Chinese art of making Guo Kui.

All of these things make the RetroDECK team... the best team to tackle this problem.
