## Missing Features

We plan to add more emulators, engines, systems, and functions over the course of the development cycle.

We do not have any plans to ship all emulators, engines, or systems in existence for each game system or console. The goal is to ship those that handle that system the best with the most features.

For the latest things The RetroDECK Team is working on check:

`General Information üì∞` - `What are you working on?` and `Version History (Patchnotes)`
