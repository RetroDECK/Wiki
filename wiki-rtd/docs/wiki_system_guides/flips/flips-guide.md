## ROM Hacks

A **ROM Hack** is a fan-made modification (mod) of a game’s original ROM file that changes or adds content. 

Some ROM hacks are compatible with each other, allowing multiple hacks to be applied to the same game for an integrated or enhanced experience.

## Before You Begin

- Always back up the original ROM before patching or modifying anything.  
- BPS patches are recommended due to better accuracy and safety.  
- Ensure the ROM used is the exact version required by the patch.  
- Errors generally indicate a mismatched or modified base ROM.  
- When applying multiple ROM hacks, **check compatibility** and follow the **recommended order**, as it can vary for each hack.
