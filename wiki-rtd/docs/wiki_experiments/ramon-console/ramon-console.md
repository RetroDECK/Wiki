# Rámons RetroDECK Console

<img src="../../../wiki_icons/pixelitos/preferences-system-splash.png" width="75">

This experiment was initiated by the user **Rámon van Raaij**. 

He made his own RetroDECK Console. 

It's RetroDECK without an Desktop Enviroment, the system boots directly into RetroDECK. 

**Note:** The RetroDECK Team did not know this was possible and RetroDECK was never intended to be used in this manner. We do find it... very cool!
