## Steam Deck - Global Controller Layout:

We have done some  changes based on community feedback

**Layout Changes:**

- `Select` is now a hotkey trigger while pressing it down, `L4` and `R4` are still triggers as well.
- The RetroArch combo of `Select`  + `Start` = `Quit` now works on many SA-Emulators.
- `Open Menu` is removed from `Select`.
- `R5`  = `A` button (this allows for great Wii controls on the right touchpad and pressing down the R5 for A).
- `L5` = `B` button.

**Global hotkey changes:**

- `Open Menu` is on `Y`.
- `Increase Emulation Speed`  is on `Dpad-UP`.
- `Decrease Emulation Speed` is on `Dpad-Down`.
- `Fullscreen OFF` command is removed (as emulators have migrated to toggle).

## Known issues

- The built in auto-updater is not working (we are working on it). Discover is ok.
- Some emulators don't have hotkey support or have bugs affecting their hotkeys.
