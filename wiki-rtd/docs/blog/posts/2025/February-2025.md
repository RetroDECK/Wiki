## Major Stonks

Let's just say we have had ***a bit*** of a spike in both users and reported issues after the Retro Game Corps bump:

## 0.9.1b

<img src="../../../logo_stacked_merged.svg" width="400"> 

We have been vigilant in monitoring all socials: Discord, Matrix, Lemmy, Reddit, Blusky, etc... for reported issues even with a bigger userbase. 

Most of the things we have been working on since the release of 0.9.0b have been tweaking and bug fixing. 

We hope to get 0.9.1b out as soon as possible (but as always no ETAs), we have also added some new features such as easier cheat management, ability to hide PortMaster and other things based on community feedback.

Read more here: [Patch 0.9.1b Notes - Preview](https://retrodeck.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wiki_rd_versions/version_0.9.0b/0.9.1b/)

As always we are always looking for more community RetroDECK-Cooker testers, do you want to sign up? 

Tell us in the 💙-i-want-to-help channel on Discord.

It's also good to read the: [Cooker Testing Guide](https://retrodeck.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wiki_development/testing/cooker-testing/)

## SRM and Steam Sync 2.0

<img src="../../../srm-logo.png" width="75"> 

The first step of Steam Sync was to get the functionality working and released inside of RetroDECK as we did as part of update 0.9.0b. We always wanted to do several improvements to it. 

The New Steam Sync will first be a lot smarter and faster than it is today. It will only do the sync when there have been any changes to the favorites lists and not at every shutdown of the application. Second, there will be two modes of Steam Sync: Automatic and Manual.

**Automatic**

Automatic Sync is as said above, it does it on application shutdown, but only when there have been favorite list changes.

**Manual**

Disables the Sync on Shutdown function and lets the user sync manually with the click of a button instead inside of the Configurator.

## Still Working on a Mascot

We have a concept for our project mascot made in VRoid Studio. We want a "Genie of Games 😉" named Rekku, who comes out of an old game cartridge. 

She should be inspired by classic Djinn characters like: I Dream of Jeannie, Jeannie (The Hanna-Barbera Show), Hakushon Daimaō (The Genie Family) and more. 

If you have 3D modeling skills and want to help, please contact the RetroDECK Team on Discord in the 💙-i-want-to-help channel.

***Update:** This idea was scraped later for a new mascot in 2026.
