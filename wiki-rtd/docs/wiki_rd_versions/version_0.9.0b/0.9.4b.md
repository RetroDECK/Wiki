## Update your ES-DE Themes

If you're experiencing crashes in ES-DE after upgrading RetroDECK to version 0.9.2b+ (ES-DE 3.2.0), it may be due to outdated themes missing new icons (like Bluetooth). To fix this:

1. Reset ES-DE using `RetroDECK Configurator` → `Reset Components` → `ES-DE`.

2. This will restore the default RetroDECK Theme.

3. Open the `Theme Downloader`, update your theme, and select it again and you should be good to go!
