## RetroDECK Framework

<img src="../../../wiki_icons/retrodeck/icon-framework.svg" width="75">

**Fixed:**

- Obliterated decorative the Bullet Point Symbol characters that caused issues on hybrid multilingual systems without a configured Flatpak languages or locale files. Users could not access certain menus like **Open Component**. This culprit right here: (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻ --->  •  <---- (weird bug!)
- Removed more unnecessary permissions in the net.retrodeck.retrodeck.yml. 
- Fixed an issue where some of the new paths (like retrodeck/storage) were being resolved prior to being set properly in finit. 

## Steam Input 

**Changed**

- **Full_Press** to **Long_Press** to reduce accidental hotkey presses. This change helps prevent unintended actions in games that require **SELECT** to be pressed in combination with other buttons. Increased all layout version numbers by **+0.1**. AKA you need to hold **SELECT** a bit longer to trigger the hotkeys. *Commits by user: Lofter1*

## Components

- RYUBING: Corrected Ryubing input issue.
- MELONDS: Corrected MelonDS bios path issue.
- GENERAL: Corrected several errors in component files for Ryubing, PCSX2, and Vita3K.
