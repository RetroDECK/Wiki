## What is RetroDECK?

RetroDECK is a [ES-DE Frontend](https://es-de.org) powered [Flatpak](https://flathub.org/apps/net.retrodeck.retrodeck) all-in-one game application that is still in development. Thanks to its `RetroDECK Framework` it builds-in a variety of software (that runs your games) like emulators and game engines in one package that is pre-configured.

### RetroDECK is easy to install

As all you need is to download it from flathub via your software center like KDE Discover or Gnome Software.

### RetroDECK is easy to update

As it updates from your software center like all other system updates.

### RetroDECK is contained

By being an all-in-one flatpak application RetroDECK is sandboxed and contained. Thus put all important files from all software in a minimal amount of locations, instead of having them spread out over your entire system. That also makes RetroDECK very easy to remove and clean-up (if you so wish).

### RetroDECK Configurator

RetroDECK features the RetroDECK Configurator that is accessible from the ES-DE main menu to allow you to change / configure settings across many systems from one interface. You can read more about the RetroDECK Configurator in the `RetroDECK: What is included?` down the page.

### RetroDECK saves space

RetroDECK also saves space comparing to installing all emulators separately as we can cross reference libraries and functions the Emulators / Engines have in common and only ship one instead of several.

## RetroDECK is currently in in BETA

The software is still under heavy development and big updates can be made that change or add certain features.

RetroDECK is missing some minor and major features that we want to add before we consider it a full release:

- Emulators
- Systems
- Features
- Configurations
- More


RetroDECK is perfectly fine for daily use even during the beta period and the core application should be seen as stable. The main reason we consider it a BETA is all the things we want to improve and add before a full 1.0 release (see the missing features list).

There are also experimental features that could be unstable but those are exclusive to the cooker builds or must be enabled by CLI.

RetroDECK during the BETA period supports the Steam Deck and the Linux Desktop. Our goal is to have the full release of RetroDECK to be as easy to use on the Linux Desktop as the Steam Deck is currently.

RetroDECK will keep developing post the full release.

### What is the difference between the main version and the cooker version?

Since the main versions is in fact the stable version, the cooker version is the unstable version that is always under heavy development.

### Missing Features

We are working on implementing all these features over the big releases. Some will take longer time than others and we will also add more things to this list when needed.

**Missing features:**

- Cloud sync
- USB transfer
- STFP / FTP
- Better gyro support.
- Dynamic external display resolution support for borders and viewports.
- Emulators & Engines supported by default ES-DE (there at least one option per system in RetroDECK).
- A rebuilt Configurator that is a Godot application that supports controller navigation.
- A rebuilt first run installer and updater in Godot.
- Better art: Mascot, Easter Eggs, Logos.
- A multi-user system with user profiles.
