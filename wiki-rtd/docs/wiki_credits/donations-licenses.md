# Information on donations

RetroDECK is nothing without our dependencies without them this project and many others like us cannot exist. Without them RetroDECK can not run any games at all, it is their software that make this possible. If you do not want to donate to RetroDECK and you might want to donate to the Frontend, art assets, a specific emulator or engine. We support you no matter what, whatever choice you take from this list will be a good one for us all.

**Please note:**

We are trying to list current and future software we want to include in RetroDECK here. More things will be added all the time. There are even more emulators, software, front-ends, and assets out there that are not part of the RetroDECK project for various other systems. This is not a complete list of all Emulators or Frontends for the entire internet.
