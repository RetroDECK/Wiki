The `texture_packs/RetroArch-Mesen/` represents `/retroarch/system/HdPacks/` folder.

**Note:** <br>
Some texture packs could made for a specific version or region of a game. Make sure you have the right game and textures for it.

## Enable Texture Packs in the Mesen core for certain games
From the `RetroArch Quick Menu`

* Go to `Core Options` -> `Enable HD Packs` set to `On`

* Then save the current configuration for that game under `Core Options` -> `Manage Core Options` -> `Save Game Options`

## How do I add texture packs that can be used by the Mesen Core?

**NOTE:** On the Steam Deck this could be easier to do in `Desktop Mode`.

* All texture packs go into the `texture_packs/RetroArch-Mesen/` folder.
* The texture pack have to be extracted from .zip or other compressed format into a folder.
* The name of the folder must be the same name as that of the rom file the texture pack is for.

**Example:**

You want apply a texture pack to a game called `ScaryCastle USA.nes` and you have downloaded the `ScaryCastle TexturePACK HD.zip`.

1. Extract the `ScaryCastle TexturePACK HD.zip`
2. Move the extracted `ScaryCastle TexturePACK HD` folder into `texture_packs/RetroArch-Mesen/`
3. Rename the `ScaryCastle TexturePACK HD` folder so it has the same name as the rom `ScaryCastle USA` without the `.nes` file extension.
9. Start up RetroDECK and select the ScaryCastle nes games. <br>
**NOTE:** On the Steam Deck go into GameMode first, then launch RetroDECK.
