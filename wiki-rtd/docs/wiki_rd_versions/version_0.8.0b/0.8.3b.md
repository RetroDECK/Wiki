## NEW Warning - Do not upgrade to 0.8.3b!

There is a bug with 0.8.3b that makes the scraped data not move to the correct folders it should, there where some unexpected scenarios that did not trigger for our testers.

The fix in 0.8.3b was not enough and we need to go deeper to fix the bug.

We will be releasing 0.8.4b as soon as we have identified all the issues.

The error is caused by that the pathing for ES-DE is not updating to the new path of /retrodeck/ES-DE/ in some instances, thus ES-DE still uses the old retrodeck/ path.

##  RetroDECK Framework / Backend:

**Fixed:**

- An issue where second level subfolders inside `retrodeck/` folder were not correctly placed and moved to the new folder structure under the `retrodeck/ES-DE`. This caused scraped data that was stored under `downloaded_media` and other ES-DE data not to be found by the ES-DE frontend.
- An issue with folder creation during initial setup that would create duplicate subfolders in some scenarios.

## Ryujinx:

- We have reverted Ryujinx to the last known working version after some testing done by the RetroDECK Team and the RetroDECK Community.

### Notice - Ryujinx Symlink Issue:

The reported issue about Ryujinx not working as well as it should with Linux symlinks still exists, please read more in the [Known Issues](../../wiki_general/known-issues.md) page. The RetroDECK Team is working with parts of the Ryujinx Team for a permanent fix with newer versions and hope to have more to share in the future.
