<img src="../../wiki_images/logos/rd-esde-logo.svg" width="400">

RetroDECK is a [ES-DE Frontend](https://es-de.org) powered [Flatpak application](https://flathub.org/apps/net.retrodeck.retrodeck) that thanks to its `RetroDECK Framework` it builds-in a variety of software like emulators or game engines that is running the games in one package.


### What does that mean?

It means that RetroDECK builds-in all the software that is running the the games and a frontend. RetroDECK then configures them for you and puts them into an all-in-one application you can download from Flathub.

By being one application RetroDECK can put all important files in one location instead of having them spread out over your entire system and even add features on top to orchestrate them seamlessly.
