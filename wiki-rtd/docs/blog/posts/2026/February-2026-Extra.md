# February 2026 - Extra: Switch Emulation Support - Will Be Removed

An extra blog post, this does not count as the regular monthly blog post. 

<!-- more -->

After waiting a full year before introducing any support for Switch emulators, in order to determine whether such projects would continue to exist, we made the decision to add limited support for Ryubing in 0.10.0b. In light of recent developments, it has become clear that this was not the right course of action.

Switch emulation has consistently been the source of the most issues within the project, generating the highest volume of warnings, bans, toxicity, and support tickets.

We would also like to note that the DMCA status of these emulators creates a level of legal exposure and implied responsibility that we are neither willing nor able to assume. RetroDECK is a volunteer-driven project, and we will not place the team or the broader community at risk by maintaining features that could subject us to takedowns, legal threats, or compliance burdens beyond our scope.

Accordingly, in an upcoming minor update, all Switch emulation support will be permanently removed from RetroDECK **forever**.

Furthermore, discussion of Switch emulation will no longer be permitted on any of our social platforms **effective immediately**, and our community rules will be updated to reflect this change.

Users who still wish to use Switch emulation **will need to configure and integrate it manually** on their own, or move it from an old install to a new one as a **user-made component** mod **without any support**. 

Please note that your existing games and save data will not be touched or removed. However, you will no longer be able to launch or play them within RetroDECK natively.

This is final!
