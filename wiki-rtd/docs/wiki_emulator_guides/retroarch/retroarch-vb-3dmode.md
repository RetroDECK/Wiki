The **Virtual Boy** originally used a stereoscopic display to create a sense of depth, similar to early VR headsets. 

Beetle VB Core can recreate this 3D effect using two different methods.

2. Open the RetroArch menu.
3. Go to **Core Options**.
4. Enter the **3D Mode** submenu.
5. Select **Anaglyph**.
6. Put on your red/blue glasses and enjoy the 3D effect.
