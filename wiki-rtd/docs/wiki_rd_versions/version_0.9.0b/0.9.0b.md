## Thanks for your patience 

We want to thank the community for being patient with waiting for the next update. 

## New Lighter Manifest

We have spent several months rewriting how RetroDECK is built from the ground up. 

In doing so we have: 

- Reduced the application size with 600mb. 
- Building RetroDECK went from 3.30 hours to 1 hour! It makes it easier for new developers to contribute. 

## Launch with RetroDECK (RetroENGINE)

You can now directly launch assign and launch game files in the Linux Desktop (Desktop Mode) with RetroDECK. 

DESCRIBE AND FANCY PICTURES 

## Launch with games via CLI

A sub function of this is that you can now launch games via CLI. 

## Steam Rom Manager & Steam Sync

RetroDECK is now shipping with SRM-built in. 

DESCRIBE AND FANCY PICTURES WITH SUGAR

## PortMaster

DESCRIBE AND FANCY PICTURES WITH SHIPS AND STUFF AND MASTERS AND MAYBE PORTS

## New RetroDECK ES-DE Theme

We got our own theme and consider it the first version of it.

## New Website

We soft launched it before, but we are considering it a part of this update! Have you found the hidden games yet?


               <li>New feature for Desktop: RetroENGINE, now RetroDECK can be used as an headless engine to run your gaems. Just duouble click them!</li>
               <li>New default theme: RetroDECK now got its own custom theme for ES-DE, do you like it? Feel free to give us feedback</li>
               <li>We soft laucnhed our new website earlier, come to take a look at retrodeck.net!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Changes:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Duckstation due to licensing changes is frozen at the latest possible build becoming de facto: Legacy</li>
               <li>Duckstation configured to use OpenGL as Vulkan seems to be broken in some cases</li>
               <li>Because of Steam Sync, Favorites collection is now enabled by default on ES-DE</li>
               <li>ES-DE Updated to 3.1.1 with language support and more</li>
               <li>ES-DE main menu tide up, because of our configurator there were too many entries, moved ES-DE specific configs inside a custom menu</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Developers, developers, developers:</p>
            <ul>
