**PlayStation Eye**

The PlayStation Eye, released on October 23, 2007, is a digital camera device developed by Sony for the PlayStation 3 console. It uses computer vision and gesture recognition to process images taken by the camera, allowing players to interact with games using motion and color detection as well as sound through its built-in microphone array. The PlayStation Eye is the successor to the EyeToy for the PlayStation 2 and features a higher resolution and frame rate, as well as improved low-light performance

**The PlayStation Move** 

Released on September 15, 2010, is a motion game controller developed by Sony for the PlayStation 3 console. It features motion sensing technology using a three-axis accelerometer, three-axis angular rate sensor, and a magnetometer. The Move controller is tracked using the PlayStation Eye camera, which detects the position and movement of the controller's glowing orb. The PlayStation Move system includes both the motion controller and the navigation controller, and it is compatible with the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation VR platforms.
