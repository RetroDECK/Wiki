Change 'Full_Press' to 'Long_Press' in controller config for preset switch
Some games have situations in which you need to or might press SELECT in combination with another button (Final Fantasy 2: SELECT + CIRCLE to open map, Ace Combat 5: SELECT switches ammunition type, might want to do while controlling your plane with L1/L2/R1/R2). This can lead to frustrating experiences where you accidentally take a screenshot or worse load a save state.
