# The Pizza War

Who will prevail?

## The Factions

### La Legione Della Pizza Italiana - LDPI

Conservative purist forces of Italian Pizza Legionnaires.

*"We invented it and made the first ovens to bake it.*

*Pizza is Italian and everything else is a facsimile, a mockery of Italian perfection and an affront to the very foundation of the imperium.* 

*Hear us citizens of imperium!*

*Our mothers and fathers gave everything to the keep the purity and sanctity of the Napoletana.*

*Sisters and brothers, the Legione calls your name, serve the imperium against the those that defile us!*

*Pax Imperium Romanum! Pax Imperium Pizzaum!"*

### The Murican Cheese Crust Patriots - MCCP

Patriotic Muricans bakers that try to crush the opposition with infinite pepperoni, cheese and bread sticks.

*"The Italian American immigrants took Pizza to the US and made it better thanks to true freedom.* 

*Are we not free to put as much pepperoni as we want? Yes we are!* 

*How about Mozzarella or bread sticks? Is there an upper limit? We say no there is not!* 

*The symbol of newfound freedom of the Italian Americans is not the cheese filled crusts?*

*All these innovations were made thanks to being free and no one... will take our freedom away!"*.


### The Nordic Pizza Cult - NPC

Free thinking viking pizza makers of the cold north. 

Label as Heretics and called "The Heresy Pizza Cult" by the others factions for their so called dark pizza viking magicks. 

*"The Italians and Americans are weak, they do not dare to take Pizza beyond their set fake borders and so called rules.* 

*Here in the cold north, we have learned and know the truth... there are no borders.* 

*Pizza is an empty canvas; it can be painted into whatever glorious image of food perfection we desire!*

*When their oven grows cold...our ovens burns eternal...not even endless winter will quench Eldhrímnir's flames!"*
