## Always Format Your SD Card & Name It Safely

**Format the card:** 

- **For Steam Deck:** `Steam` → `Storage` → select your SD card → press `Y` → `Format Drive`.
- **Other OS:** Check that OS documentation. 

**Use only letters and numbers:** 

- Stick to **A–Z**, **a–z**, and **0–9**.  
- Avoid **spaces, emojis, accents (é, ñ), and special characters**.

**Why avoid special characters?**

Special characters can cause many issues on Linux:

- **Command line problems:** Characters like spaces, `!`, `&`, and `?` can break commands unless properly escaped.
- **Script errors:** Some software handles special characters poorly and may crash or behave unpredictably.
- **File transfer issues:** Certain network or transfer protocols choke on unusual characters.
