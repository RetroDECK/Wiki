## 0.10.0b Testing Status

Testing is progressing well thanks to our community testers. A Steam Input related bug was identified, documented, and reported to Valve.

Current efforts are focused on polishing, iteration, and bug fixing, and steady progress is being made.

### Release when?!

**When it’s ready!**

With major holidays approaching, contributors to this volunteer project will have limited availability due to real-life things.

### Throw us a bone! The holidays are coming!

Ok!

A 🎁 in the form of a preview of upcoming changes, see the next section for the patch notes and a short 0.11.0b preview.

## 🎁 Preview: 0.11.0b DOSBox-X

For version 0.11.0b (the major update following 0.10.0b), we plan to integrate DOSBox-X. Instead of a standard implementation, we aim to provide a **RetroDECK-style experience**.

The goal is to allow Windows 3.1 and 95/98 games to launch directly without navigating the legacy operating systems. Similar to our treatment of OpenBOR and Doom, each game will have its own wrapper to simplify launching.

An early prototype video is available below:

## That is all for now 

There are more things we are working on, but you will see them in future blog updates!

And as always if you want to help with development join the 💙-i-want-to-help channel on Discord.

Thank you to everyone for your continued support. Our ARMs are officially worn out from all the typing, we may need to look into putting them them into a FRAME.
