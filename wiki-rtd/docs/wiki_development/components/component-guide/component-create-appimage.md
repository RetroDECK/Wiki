# Creating Component: AppImage

<img src="../../../../wiki_images/logos/appimage-logo.svg" width="100">

This a part of the How-to: Create Components Guide

We are going to use CEMU as an example and remember that each AppImage is different from another. 

**Note:**

This assumes you have read [Creating Component: Guide](creating-components-guide.md).

---

## Step 0: Make a testing folder 

1. Have a local copy of RetroDECK Cooker installed.
2. Create a components folder under retrodeck/ userdata folder.
3. **Result:** `retrodeck/components/`

---

## Step 1: Download the AppImage from Source

1. Download the file from Github/Website or where every you find it.
2. Put it into `retrodeck/components/`.
3. Create a folder in `retrodeck/components/<component_name>` that matches the name of the component you want to add.

**Example:**


```
wget "https://github.com/cemu-project/Cemu/releases/download/v2.6/Cemu-2.6-x86_64.AppImage"
```

1. Put it into `retrodeck/components/Cemu-2.6-x86_64.AppImage`.
2. Create a folder called `retrodeck/components/cemu`.

---

## Step 2: Permissions & Extract 

Open a terminal window in `retrodeck/components/`

**Set Permissions:**

```
chmod +x "XXX.AppImage"
```

**Extract it:**

```
./XXX.AppImage --appimage-extract
```

**Example:**

```
chmod +x "Cemu-2.6-x86_64.AppImage"`
./Cemu-2.6-x86_64.AppImage --appimage-extract
```

---

## Step 3: New folder and move.

A new folder called `retrodeck/components/squashfs-root` has been created.

The structure is different in each AppImage.

**AppRun** exists in every AppImage and it can be either a:

- Script (that launches the binary).
- Binary (separate but launches the main binary).
- Symlink (to the main binary).

Other standard files such as: **icons**, **.desktop** also exist in every AppImage. 

Most follow this structure (with additional folders and files depending on the app):

```
squashfs-root
    - AppRun (a script, binary or symlink)
    - usr
        - bin (contains the binary)
        - lib   
        - share
```

### Examples of AppImage Structures

#### Emulators 

**Cemu**

```
squashfs-root
    - AppRun
    - apprun-hooks
    - checkrt
    - usr
        - bin (contains the binary)
        - lib   
        - share
```

**Azahar**

```
squashfs-root
    - AppRun 
    - apprun-hooks
    - checkrt
    - usr
        - bin (contains the binary)
        - lib   
        - share
        - plugins
        - translations
```

---

#### Engines 

**Mudlet**

```
squashfs-root
    - AppRun 
    - <translation files>
    - doc (licences)
    - lcf
    - lib
    - mudlet (binary)
    - mudlet-lua
    - plugins
    - translations
```

---

#### Systems

**ES-DE:**

```
squashfs-root
    - AppRun (a script, binary or symlink)
    - usr
        - bin (contains the binary)
        - lib   
        - share
```

---

#### Ports 

**OpenGOAL:**

```
squashfs-root
    - AppRun
    - apprun-hooks
    - checkrt
    - usr
        - bin (contains the binary)
        - lib   
        - share
```

**Ship of Harkinian**

```
squashfs-root
    - AppRun (a script, binary or symlink)
    - usr
        - bin (contains the binary)
        - lib   
        - share
```

**Osu!**

```
squashfs-root
    - AppRun (a script, binary or symlink)
    - usr
        - bin (contains the binary)  
        - share
```

---

## Step 4: Identify Key Parts in squashfs-root

Identify the:

- Binary
- Libraries
- Other important files

**Example:**

Cemu

In the terminal move out key parts 

```
mv squashfs-root/apprun-hooks cemu/
mv squashfs-root/usr/* cemu/
```

---

## Step 5: AppImages & Libraries

**Note**

Just because it's an AppImage doesn't mean it has *everything* it needs. 

Sometimes, a library might be missing from the AppImage **and** the Flatpak runtime. 
It might work on your host OS, but fail inside Flatpak.

Always test the Component within the flatpak shell to see if any libraries are missing. 

LibMan can help but don't 100% rely on it to figure it out. 

If they are missing try to add them to the components lib or the shared-libs.
