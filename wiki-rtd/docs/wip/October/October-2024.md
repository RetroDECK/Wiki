Developer MonkeyX of the RetroDECK Team is hard at work with his Godot Magic (we are happy to have him).

## PortMaster - Status

The [PortMaster](https://portmaster.games/games.html) `x86_64` version is coming along slow and steady.

We are working togheter with the PortMaster team to make this happen. It offers a plethora of FOSS games, game engines and other custom games.

Thanks PortMaster Team ‚ù§Ô∏è

**Question: How many ports are available currently in development?**

So far there about 40-50 ports already for x86-64.

As stated in a previous blog the goal is NOT to have all 600+ ports in x86-64 as it does not makes sense. Only games that have

**Question: Where will the portmaster ports directory be?**

It will be under `roms/portmaster/`

**Question: Will PortMaster be part of 0.9.0b?**

We *hope* to ship is as part of the update. But it is also a quite big feature in addition to the Godot Configuror (let's see where we are when the time comes).

## Ryujinx Issues - Status



We are still working with and having open dialog with the Ryujinx Team on this.

They hope to make their pathing more dynamic to solve that the Emulator can't find several files in an upcoming Ryujinx update. But the problem is quite complex.

In any case 0.9.0b will have fixes for this either via a custom Ryujinx RetroDECK build or that the main application has been updated with the dynamic pathing.

Thanks Ryujinx Team ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Steam ROM Manager - SRM (Add to Steam) - Status

We have had good dialog and cooperation with the SRM Team to make this feature a reality. But RetroDECK's implementation is quite different as we don't plan to let the users open the SRM interface at all as it will be preconfigured in the back-end.

The goal is the same as a blogpost from way in the past with a much more seamless and elegant solution.

1. You enable the system from the Configurator.
2. Games you mark as ‚≠ê favorites in the ES-DE interface will be synced to Steam as separate game entries in your library.
3. The sync will scrape the art from SteamGridDB and add our controller profile on the games.
4. You can launch the game as an individual entry.

Thanks SRM Team ‚ù§Ô∏è

### Question - SRM: Will this be part of 0.9.0b?

Right now we don't know it is still quite complex, no promises. We are working on so many things as you can see.

### Question - SRM: If all settings are in the back-end can I enable the filters?

You will not be able to choose what artwork is pulled for each game if many exists as it will just grab the first one.

If possible we plan to expose all those important filter values inside the Godot Configurator. With various dropdowns menus, toggles and checkboxes.

SRM filters:

<img src="../SRM-filters.png" width="800">

**Example:**

The `Grid Style` filter has the values of:

- Any
- Alternate
- Blurred
- White logo
- Material
- No logo

We plan to expose all of those values in some graphical form inside the Configurator (if possible).


#### But what about that ONE toggle?

We are aware that we have community members that consider themselves a:

```
Person of CULTURE.
Man of CULTURE.
Woman of CULTURE.
Anthropomorphic Animal of CULTURE.
Anthropomorphic Blue Dragonkin of CULTURE.
Sentient Furniture of CULTURE.
Virtual Avatar of CULTURE.
Undead Creature of CULTURE.
Italian.
<Custom Value> of CULTURE.
```

Yes, as stated above if it is part of SRM's filters we will expose it including the toggle for NSFW artwork.
