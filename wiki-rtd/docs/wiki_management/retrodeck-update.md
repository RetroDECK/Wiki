## Software Manager (Recommended)

Most distributions automatically manage updates for Flatpak applications, including RetroDECK.

- **Steam Deck (Optional):** Switch to **Desktop Mode**  
  `Steam Button` → **Power** → **Switch to Desktop**
- Open **Discover** or your preferred software manager.
- Navigate to the **Updates** section.
- Review available updates.
- Select **Update** or **Update All** to install them.

## Terminal

You can update all installed Flatpaks, including RetroDECK, using the command line:  `flatpak update -y`

## Steam Deck - Decky Loader: AutoFlatpaks

If you have **Decky Loader** installed along with the **AutoFlatpaks** plugin, you can update RetroDECK directly from **Game Mode** without switching to Desktop Mode.

| **Updating After a Long Time**             | If you have not updated RetroDECK for an extended period (approximately one year or more), it is recommended to **uninstall and reinstall** RetroDECK through your software manager rather than performing an in-place upgrade. |
