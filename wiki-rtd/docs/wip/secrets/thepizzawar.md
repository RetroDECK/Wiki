Who will prevail?

## The Factions

## La Legione Della Pizza Italiana - LDPI

*"Pizza is Italian and everything else is a facsimile, a mockery of Italian perfection and an affront to the very foundation of the imperium* 

*Hear us citizens of imperium! Our mothers and fathers gave everything to the keep the purity and sanctity of the Napoletana! We all must serve!*

*Pax Romanum Imperium! Pax Pizza Imperium!"*

### The Murican Cheese Crust Patriots - MCCP

Patriotic Muricans bakers that try to crush the opposition with infinite pepperoni, cheese and bread sticks.

*"The Italian American immigrants took Pizza to the US and made it better thanks to true freedom.* 

*Are we not free to put as much pepperoni as we want? Yes we are!* 

*How about Mozzarella or bread sticks? Is there an upper limit? We say no there is not!* 

*The symbol of newfound freedom of the Italian Americans is not the cheese filled crusts?*

*All these innovations were made thanks to being free and no one... will take our freedom away!"*.


### The Nordic Pizza Cult - NPC

Label as Heretics by the others for their dark pizza viking magicks. 

*"The Italians and Americans are weak, they do not dare to take Pizza beyond their set fake borders and so called rules.* 

*Here in the cold north, we have learned and now know the truth... there are no borders.* 

*Here us brothers and sisters Pizza is an empty canvas; it can be painted into whatever glorious image of food perfection we desire!*

*When their oven grows cold...our ovens burns eternal...not even endless winter will quench these flames"*
