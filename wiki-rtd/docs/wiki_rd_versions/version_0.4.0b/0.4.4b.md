<img src="../../../wiki_images/logos/rd-logo-box.png" width="600">

**Release Date:** 2022-07-18

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

At the moment the emulator configs are reset during every update, this was made because every version may bring new configurations, please back them up if you did some manual configs.

**Emulators:**
            
- Yuzu: Disabled shader caching as it was broken.
- Yuzu: Switched from vulkan to opengl as Vulkan is experimental and it's not working correctly for the games majority, you can set Vulkan by opening yuzu from Tools -> Start Yuzu.
- Yuzu: Edited Hotkeys (see wiki).
- Yuzu: Increased performances.
- Yuzu: Fixed graphics and scaling.
- Yuzu: Fixed right control stick.
- PCSX2: Symlinked bios/pcsx folder in /bios to solve issue#63.

            
**Backend**:
            
- Uploaded a test Steam Controller config, you can download it from community controller configs on Steam.
- Unhidden .themes and .downloaded_media folders.
- Moved the lockfile in the internal folders.
- General code cleanup.
            
**Known Issues:**
            
- PCSX2: due to its limitation, the standalone PCSX2 doesn't have any way to set the hotkeys, so no save and load state, no quit button. In order to quit press: STEAM -> CLOSE WINDOW, be aware that the state is not automatically saved.
- External controllers and keyboard seems not to be working, expecially in the desktop mode.
