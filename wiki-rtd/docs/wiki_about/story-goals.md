## RetroDECK's Story: How RetroDECK was born?

<img src="../../wiki_images/logos/351e-deck-logo.png" width="400">

Let's take a step back.

RetroDECK was born on **March 4th, 2022, in Kyoto, Japan**, originally under the name **351EDECK**.  

I am also one of the founding members of **351ELEC** (now **AmberELEC**). My initial goal was to "port" 351ELEC to the Steam Deck. But rather than creating custom firmware to flash, I wanted to deliver it as a full application that could be launched directly from Steam.

After discussing with the 351ELEC team, we decided not to support another platform like the Steam Deck. I chose to continue the project independently and renamed it **RetroDECK**.  

Early on, I explored several ways to package 351EDECK: a bash script, AppImage, or Flatpak. Initially, I opted for a **simple shell script**, and **RetroDECK (aka 351EDECK v0.1a)** existed only as a script.  

However, the community raised concerns about security and people were hesitant to grant root privileges to a random script downloaded from the internet. Evaluating the Steam Deck use case, I realized that approach was not suitable. Users wanted a safer, packaged solution.

Valve recommends **Flatpak** for porting applications to the Steam Deck. Following their guidelines, I reworked the project into the **RetroDECK** we know today. Development started on a **Manjaro virtual machine**, as I didn’t yet have access to a Steam Deck.

## RetroDECK's Development Philosophy 

Emulation, engine re-implementations, fantasy consoles, and related projects are global, multi-generational efforts fueled by a shared love of video game preservation. RetroDECK depends on the ongoing work of these projects: emulators, front-ends, game engines, systems, assets, and more. It would be unfair to claim credit, obscure their contributions, or monetize their work for our own gain. Their software is what makes running these games possible RetroDECK is just the platform that brings it together.

We fully support free and open-source video game preservation and reject predatory profit models. RetroDECK is committed to openness: there will be no misleading donation schemes or artificial divides between paying and non-paying users.

We aim to maintain strong, respectful relationships with the teams behind the third-party software we rely on. Everyone involved in RetroDECK is deeply grateful for their work...without these projects and passionate contributors, RetroDECK simply wouldn’t exist.

For more information on our dependencies and how to support them, see the Donations & License page on our wiki.

**To the developers of third-party projects:**

We warmly invite you to reach out, share your ideas, and collaborate with us.

Your feedback and suggestions are invaluable. You are the backbone of RetroDECK, and we deeply appreciate your contributions.
