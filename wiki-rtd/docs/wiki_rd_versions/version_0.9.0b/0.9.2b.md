<img src="../../../wiki_icons/pixelitos/steam-rom-manager.png" width="50">


Steam Sync Version 2.0 is here! This is the next step in the Steam Sync function we launched with 0.9.0b.

It now supports two Sync Modes and has a complimentary troubleshooting purge tool as well:

- **Automatic Steam Sync**: Sync ES-DE favorites to Steam automatically when RetroDECK quits. You can enable or disable this feature.

- **Manual Steam Sync**: Perform a one-time manual sync of ES-DE favorites to Steam whenever you want.

- **New Tool: Purge Steam Sync Shortcuts**: This tool performs a full Steam ROM Manager purge of all favorites in Steam (in case things have gotten messed up).

The new version is also **much faster and smarter** than before. 

- **Note:** The speed of downloading media files will still depend on your internet bandwidth and may take some time.

## Backup RetroDECK Tool 2.0

The new version of the Backup RetroDECK tool offers more backup options and is significantly faster. It includes three types of backups:

- **Core Backup**: Backs up only essential files, such as saves, states, and gamelists.

- **Custom Backup**: Allows you to select specific folders to back up.

- **Complete Backup**: Backs up all data, including games and downloaded media.

Additionally, the Backup RetroDECK tool will now prompt users to perform an optional backup before upgrading RetroDECK to a new version.

## Compression Tool Improvements

The Compression RetroDECK tool has significantly improved its speed by utilizing the system's CPU cores more efficiently. 

In some cases, the speed increase has been between **100-400%**, depending on the hardware.

## New Tool: Repair Paths

If your RetroDECK folder is lost, this function repairs RetroDECK paths without needing a full reset. 

It will automatically attempt to find common RetroDECK paths. 

If RetroDECK can't be found, it will ask you to specify the location.

## New Tool: Logging Level Changer

<img src="../../../wiki_icons/pixelitos/mate-system-log.png" width="50"> 

This tool lets you control how much information is logged in `retrodeck/logs`.

There are four levels:

- **Level 1: Informational**: The default setting, logs only basic important information.
- **Level 2: Warnings**: Logs general warnings.
- **Level 3: Errors**: Logs more detailed error messages.
- **Level 4: Debug**: Logs everything, which may generate a lot of logs.

In the stable version of RetroDECK, the default is **Level 1: Informational**.

In the unstable cooker builds, the default is **Level 4: Debug**.

## Question - Other Systems Updates?

We are currently rewriting how system updates (emulators, engines, other systems) are handled in RetroDECK. Our goal is to make the system more contained within the application to reduce library and dependency conflicts that have plagued us in the past.

Once this is complete, we will ship new versions. This will make it easier to update systems in the future and add more systems.

The team thanks the community for its understanding.
