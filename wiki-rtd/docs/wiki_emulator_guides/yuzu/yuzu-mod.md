`TITLEID` is different for every game.

## How do I add mods?

**Requirements:** Mod files <br>

**NOTE:** On the Steam Deck this could be easier to do in `Desktop Mode`.

There are two ways of adding mods into Yuzu

### From Yuzu directly

2. Open up Yuzu inside `RetroDECK Configurator` by pressing `Open Emulator` - `Yuzu`.
3. Right click on the game you want to add mods into.
4. Click on `Open Mod Data Destination`.
5. Paste the mod folders inside that directory.
6. Right clicking on the game and selecting `Properties`.
7. Enable the mods you want to enable by pressing the checkboxes in the `Add-Ons` tab and press OK.
8. Quit Yuzu

### From the mods/yuzu folder


1. Extract any mod files from compressed `.zip` or any other format into folders.
2. Go into `~/retrodeck/mods/yuzu/` and file the right folder for the game you want to add mods to. The folders are all named by `TITLEID`.
3. Move those folders into `~/retrodeck/mods/yuzu/<TITLEID>`
4. Open up Yuzu inside `RetroDECK Configurator` by pressing `Open Emulator` - `Yuzu`.
5. Right clicking on the game and selecting `Properties`.
