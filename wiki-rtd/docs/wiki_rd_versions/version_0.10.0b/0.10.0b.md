## Rewrote Everything from the Ground Up  

Over **1 500+** commits later, the changes are too extensive for line‑by‑line patch notes, so here’s a high‑level overview:



**Core Architecture**

- Completely rebuilt how all components interact within RetroDECK and RetroDECK itself. 
- Overhauled the entire build pipeline. 
- Refactored the `net.retrodeck.retrodeck.yml` configuration file for clearer structure, easier maintenance and made it oh so pretty.
- Introduced the **RetroDECK API**.
- Implemented an **Alchemist Component System**. 
- Upgraded to org.kde.platform 6.10.

**Component Management**

- Made a modular component system where each component is isolated in it's own sub‑sandbox.
- Redesigned library and dependency handling, ensuring each component pulls only what it needs.

**Permissions & Security**

- Significantly reduced the default permissions granted to the RetroDECK application.
- Added granular, purpose‑driven permission sets with explicit rationales for each in the `net.retrodeck.retrodeck.yml`.

<img src="../../../wiki_images/logos/es-de-logo.png" width="100">

We only list the RetroDECK specific changes here, check the full: [ES-DE: Changelog](https://gitlab.com/es-de/emulationstation-de/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

**Note:** 

- The **ES‑DE: Game Importer** function (e.g., importing Steam games and such) does not work with RetroDECK and has been disabled.

**Changes:** 

- Several folders have been hidden because they aren't supported in RetroDECK (e.g., `Lutris`, `Epic`, `Windows`, and others) to avoid confusion.  
- The `Desktop` folder remains available for various community tinkering experiments.


**Added:** 

- In `es_find_rules.xml`, the `<emulator name="FLATPAKSPAWN">` has been added, making it easier for users who want to tinker with RetroDECK and break out of the sandbox.
- The RetroDECK Theme has been updated with all the new features of ES-DE 3.4.0 such as Played Time.

**Fixed:** 

- A number of alternative emulators that were mistakenly displayed, though unavailable in RetroDECK have now been hidden.

**Known Issue:** 

- The **ES‑DE Configurations** submenu in RetroDECK's ES‑DE does not yet support translations. Translation support is planned for a future release.
