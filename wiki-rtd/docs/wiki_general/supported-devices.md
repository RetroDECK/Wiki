RetroDECK was originally built with the **Steam Deck** in mind, and the project began as a way to bring a unified emulation experience to this device.

RetroDECK runs on standard **Linux desktop systems**, but its advanced hotkey features rely on **Steam Input**. 
For the best experience, we recommend using a distribution with a built-in “Game Mode,” such as **SteamOS**, **Bazzite**, **ChimeraOS**, and others.
