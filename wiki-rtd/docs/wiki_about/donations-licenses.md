# Donations & Licenses

## Information

RetroDECK thrives thanks to the open‑source community and depends on a wide range of third‑party libraries, systems and tools. 

Without those dependencies, neither RetroDECK nor many similar projects could exist. 

Our philosophy is to collaborate openly with other projects to improve both RetroDECK and the broader Linux ecosystem.

We list current and future software and functions we want to include in RetroDECK and their licenses. More items will be added in upcoming updates.

There are many emulators, software, front-ends, and assets not part of RetroDECK. This is not a complete list of all emulators or frontends on the internet.

### Support the right place

If you want to fund a specific frontend, art asset, emulator, engine, or other we always encourage you to donate directly to that project/person and not via proxy. 

No other project should control another projects funds. 

Always make sure that the funds are getting to the right person. Direct contributions to the projects you care about are always preferred.

## RetroDECK

<img src="../../wiki_icons/retrodeck/icon-rd.svg" width="75">

By donating to RetroDECK, you support the project and the vision of a unified experience.

> **Important:** Donations do **not** grant any special privileges, perks, or such things. They simply support the ongoing development and maintenance of the hobby project. We also don't want excessive donations, donate to our dependencies instead. 

### How We Use Your Contributions

| Area                         | What It Funds |
|--------------------------------|------------------|
| **Infrastructure**            | Web hosting, build servers, and other hosting costs |
| **Development Tools**         | Software licenses (we prioritize FOSS and Creative‑Commons whenever possible) |
| **UI & Artwork**              | Commissioned UI elements and artwork from artists (again, favoring FOSS/CC‑licensed assets) |
| **Hardware (rarely)**   | New devices for testing and development (see details below) |

#### Rare Hardware Purchases

From time to time the RetroDECK team may need to acquire new hardware to test compatibility or develop new features. We will always ask the community beforehand if we plan to make such a purchases.

- **Gaming handhelds** – e.g., Steam Deck, ROG Ally.
- **Controllers** – both major‑brand and niche options for comprehensive testing and making profiles for.
- **Exotic Special peripherals** – light guns, racing wheels, X‑Arcade cabinets, V‑Boards, XAC, rythm etc.

> **Important:** As of now no such purchases have been made, all hardware and have been bought by RetroDECK Team members personal funds.
