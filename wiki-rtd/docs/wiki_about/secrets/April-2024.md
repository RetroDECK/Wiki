## Bonsai Banana - Released

We thank everyone for your patience.

The update was hard to get out as it needed major back-end changeds to accommodate both Ponzu and all the major structural changes brought by the ES-DE 3.0 update.

We opted for an more extended testing period as well to make sure everything was as safe as possible, but as always there will be bugs we have missed and no software is bug free.

One such thing we missed in testing was those people that had made custom ES-DE Collections, as they where never handled by RetroDECK proper and moved into the /retrodeck folder but we plan to address them in an upcoming update and move them to a safer location.



## PortMaster ❤️ RetroDECK

We are proud to announce that the parts of the RetroDECK Team, Batocera Team and PortMaster Team is going bring [PortMaster](https://portmaster.games/index.html) to x86_64 systems.

RetroDECK's goal is to have it ship natively and built-in... and guess what?!

It already works in our early POC!

Not all ports have x86_64 versions but more will be added over time and a lot of work left to do for all of us.

### What is PortMaster?

It is a Linux Port Manager to easy download, manage, create and play various Linux game ports.
In many of the ports you will need to own game and take files from the original game for the ports to work.

### There exists other ways to run the same games?!

Yes, there exists many ways to run these ports and games outside of PortMaster.

PortMaster was born from the scope of arm based handheld gaming devices as a way to play games not available for those systems.

For certain ports it might make more sense to install them directly via:

- [Luxtorpeda](https://github.com/dreamer/luxtorpeda)
- [Lutris](https://lutris.net/)
- [Flathub](https://flathub.org/en)
- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/)
- [Heroic](https://heroicgameslauncher.com/)
- [MiniGalaxy](https://sharkwouter.github.io/minigalaxy/)

Some ports are however very hard to install for the avarage user and PortMaster makes it a breeze to install.

What we are doing is proving you with a new option within RetroDECK.

## That is all for April

Thanks everyone!
