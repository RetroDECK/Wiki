# Information on donations

RetroDECK is nothing without our dependencies without them this project and many others like us cannot exist. Without them RetroDECK can not run any games at all, it is their software that make this possible. We always strive to do more cooperation between projects for the betterment of RetroDECK and Linux as a whole.

If you do not want to donate to RetroDECK and you might want to donate to the Frontend, art assets, a specific emulator or engine. We support you no matter what, whatever choice you take from this list will be a good one for us all. The goal of the RetroDECK project is not to make money for profit, this is just a pure passion project.

**If you feel passionate about a specific emulator / engine / other always make sure you donate to them directly and not via proxy. No project should be the arbiter of another projects funds.**

### About this page

We are trying to list current and some future software and functions we want to include in RetroDECK here and their licenses (not everything is added to RetroDECK proper yet). More things will be added all the time in upcoming updates on this page and in RetroDECK.

There are even more emulators, software, front-ends, and assets out there that are not part of the RetroDECK project for various other systems. This is not a complete list of all Emulators or Frontends for the entire internet.
