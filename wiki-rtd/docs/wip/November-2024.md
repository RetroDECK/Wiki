## Development is a bit slower  
  
Please note that this is a big release with several features that requires coordination of several people that spends their free time doing this.

We had an internal goal of December but sometimes IRL issues happen that takes away that time (work, family, life, death, love, etc..). 

It is a huge endeavor as we are rewriting several aspects of RetroDECK and adding tons of new features. Thus we cannot give any ETA's on when 0.9b will be released and done.

## New website 

We are secretly soft launched our new website during Halloween. 

[RetroDECK NEW Website](https://retrodeck.net/)

Check it out and give feedback on the Discord on Lemmy.  

Thanks `Adam Iannazzone` for all his hard work on contributing his free time to the RetroDECK project and the new website.

## 3DS Emulation - status 

We had secret plans to include Lime3DS into the release of 0.9b. 

But as the big Citra forks are merging into one, it feels better to wait until they have sorted everything out.

It is better to get the best project into RetroDECK proper. 

When their new repo is up and running, we will target that.

## Xenia - status 

We are looking into utilizing [UMU Launcher](https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher) for Xenia (and other Wine based systems in the future). 

Instead of pulling in all vanilla Wine into RetroDECK and configuring it, UMU Launcher feels like a better architectural choice that can give more synergies in the future. 

We are waiting for the magnificent Open Wine Components Team (Heroic Game Launcher, Lutris, Bottles, Lutris, Proton-GE and more) to finish their Flatpak version.

## Godot Configurator - status 

**Game Mode â€“ No web browser / markdown viewer**

Game Mode has no included web browser that can be called via Flatpak thus rendering the wiki links and website links useless in Game Mode.  
 
The buttons that go to the website and wiki will be kept but only shown in Desktop Mode / Linux Desktop.  
 
We currently do not feel like we want to ship an entire web browser inside of RetroDECK to remedy it.  
 
Instead of a web browser, we are looking into a sophisticated markdown viewer instead to integrate into RetroDECK.  
 
The general thought is if we can provide an option to manually synchronize the entire wiki down to local storage with the click of a button and have it readable no matter if you are online or offline and viewed via the markdown viewer.

## Merged Chungus Cooker 

Several of the big feature branches are now merged into Cooker proper (creating one chunky boi). 

Having one big cooker now will make it easier to test everything that 0.9b has to offer. 

In the future we might utilize the Flathub-beta remote to facilitate easy testing when the cooker is more stable. 

The current cooker now features most of 0.9b: 

- SRM (Add to Steam) 

- Godot Configurator 

- Updated Emulators / Components 

- PortMaster 

- Lighter Manifest 

- Ruffle

## Known issues in cooker 

There is still plenty of work to do and we always do need more people testing and developing. 

This is a list of significant issues we are investigating. 

If you want to help with parts of development or testing, please contact us on `Matrix` / `Discord` in the `ðŸ’™-i-want-to-help` channel.

### Lighter Manifest 

- There still are some issues when building certain systems and features via the new pipelines. Not all systems are updated yet.

### SRM 

- Is not yet added to Godot Configurator and need to be enabled from Legacy Configurator. 

- Not all systems are adding the games as they should.

### Godot Configurator 

- Bash slowdown for certain scripts if launched via Godot Configurator via Steam. 

- Need to add some more menus / buttons. 

- Needs more testing of all the features.

### Emulators / Components 



- Not all emulators have been updated yet as some have added additional dependencies we need to build. 

- Ryujinx is disabled at this moment, because of bugs.

### PortMaster  



- No reported issues
