You need to meet the following prerequisites before you start following this guide:

* You need to have a device to install RetroDECK on.

* Have game backups of various formats ready that you want to play

## Step 1: Installation & Configuration

## Step 2: BIOS & Firmware

**NOTE:** On the Steam Deck this step needs to be done in Desktop Mode

### Information

Read up on [Manage your BIOS/Firmware](../wiki_management/bios-firmware.md)

* The BIOS & Firmware files go into the `~/retrodeck/bios/` directory


**Example:**

## Step 3: ROMs

**NOTE:** On the Steam Deck this step needs to be done in Desktop Mode

### On ROMs

Note that the `roms` folder location can be different depending on where you choose to put it during the installation process. The following options are available during the installation:

#### **Choice: Internal**

If during the installation of RetroDECK you choose the Internal option for the roms folder:
The roms folder is:`~/retrodeck/roms/`

#### **Choice: SDCard**

If during the installation of RetroDECK you choose the SDCard option for the roms folder:
The roms folder is: `<sdcard>/retrodeck/roms/`

(Please note that the `<sdcard>` is an example and not called so inside your Linux/SteamOS system but rather your unique per SDCard ID number).

#### **Choice: Custom**

If during the installation of RetroDECK you choose the Custom option for the roms folder:<br>
The roms folder wherever you choose.
