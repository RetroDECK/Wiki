## MORE! RetroDECK Experiments ‚öóÔ∏è on the Wiki

<img src="../../../icon-rd.svg" width="75"> 

Back in March, we added an "RetroDECK Experiments" section to the wiki to collect and organize community tinker projects in one spot. 

The collective "scientific works" of the community tinkerers since then will be shown today on Labor Day.

The RetroDECK Team is excited to showcase their creativity. 

For us it was important to centralize this on the wiki, as these types of guides are often scattered across various platforms like:

- Forums
- Social media 
- Reddit / Lemmy 
- Discord / Revolt 
- Other

The goal was to make them easily accessible from a single source.

### Disclaimer on Experiments

These experiments are created by the RetroDECK Team and/or Community. The guides are intended for people with technical knowledge and a passion for tinkering. Using these guides might put RetroDECK and your data at risk. The RetroDECK Team can't provide any support for these experiments or fix any issues they might cause on your system or RetroDECK installation.

Now, let's present the experiments so far!

## Experiment: Autoboot into RetroDECK and not Game Mode

<img src="../../../preferences-system-splash.png" width="50">

This experiment was initiated by the user **Daeymon** and later expanded upon by the RetroDECK Team. Daeymon goal was to explore the possibility of autobooting into RetroDECK when the Steam Deck's Game Mode is launched directly and not into the Steam Game Mode UI.

## Experiment: RetroDECK ES-DE Background Music

<img src="../../../applications-multimedia.png" width="50">

This experiment was initiated by the users **Partack** and **TopHatCat**, then later expanded upon by the RetroDECK Team. The goal was to explore the possibility of doing custom scripts to enable very basic music playback in ES-DE.

## Experiment: Launching Games & Apps with RetroDECK

This experiment was initiated by the users **murkl** and **Daeymon**.

We already featured in back in March blog in a limited way but more guides have been added and expanded upon since then. 

### Flatpak Games & Apps

### Minecraft Instances

This guide shows you how-to add Prism Launcher Minecraft instances into  into RetroDECK (as seperate games).

### Heroic Games & Apps

### Steam Games & Apps

## Experiment: Launching External Emulators

<img src="../../../dolphin-logo.png" width="50">

This experiment was initiated by the user **TopHatCat** and later expanded upon by the RetroDECK Team. TopHatCats goal was to explore the possibility of launching games against external Emulators from within RetroDECK (limited to the systems ES-DE supports).

**However, doing this defeats the entire purpose of RetroDECK!** 

Essentially, you are creating an Anti-RetroDECK / Bizzaro-RetroDECK / Absolute Heresy inside of RetroDECK.

## Experiment: Run RetroDECK in WSL on Windows 11

<img src="../../../windows.png" width="50">

This experiment was initiated by a spontaneous idea from the RetroDECK Team (someone on the team was on a mandatory lunch break at work and decided to do something to pass the time after quickly gobbling up their sandwich).

**Note:** RetroDECK was never intended to be used in this manner and the performance is horrible and it is very stupid (don't do this).

We‚Äôve kicked off work on version 0.10.0b, and our vision is huge! 

We‚Äôll share more details once we know what‚Äôs possible. It‚Äôs a big challenge, but who doesn‚Äôt love a good challenge?!

Hopefully we got more to share in June, there is some information in the interview above.

## That is all for now 

There are more things we are working on, but you will see them in future blog updates!
