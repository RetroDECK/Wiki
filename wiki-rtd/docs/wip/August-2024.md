## 0.8.3 Scraping data issue

There was an scraping data issue we tried to fix in 0.8.3 data issue affecting some systems that did not move the folders like downloaded_media correctly or it did not update the variables where the data was located after the move.

### Better testing

We always try our best to test various features but the change was quite complex and we missed a few scenarios and we are looking over our testing routines to make things even better. The team hopes in the long run we have more community beta testers volunteering and we have develop some automated testing tools.

If you want to help with testing contact us on Discord or Matrix.

## NEWS: Lighter Manifest for 0.9b

Now this might not be so exiting for the majority of our userbase but we have begun rewriting the entire RetroDECK flatpak manifest for 0.9. This allows us to find even better synergies between emulator/engine dependencies, cut down build time and reduce space.

In short what we have done is separated the build from what was a monolithic approach where everything was built in one instance to a modular approach where each subsystem/emulator/engine has it's own building environment and the main RetroDECK project just builds together all those modules.

It will also make it easier in the long run to add more system.

The results so far are:

RetroDECK's build time have been reduced by about **70-75%** from about 3.30 hours to about 45 minutes.

We have saved a larger amount of storage space space 350-500mb of in the finished product (but this will probably be taken up later when we add all the new systems).




## That is all for now

Thanks everyone!
