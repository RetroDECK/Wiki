- **COMPRESSION:** CHDMAN (.chd compression) is looking at the right paths and is now working again.

**Added:**

- **BACKUP:** Simplified the backup prompt and choices.
- **COMPRESSION:**  CHDMAN now also checks: arcade, atomiswave, cdimono1, cdtv, fmtowns, megacdjp, mess, naomi, neogeocdjp as valid compression targets.
- **FRAMEWORK:** Updated the handling of MelonDS’s new config format.
- **FOLDER ICONS:** Added a folder icon for PrimeHack.
- **PRIMEHACK:** Separated the PrimeHack component and added its own folder in `roms/primehack` based on user feedback.

## Components

**Fixed:**

**AZAHAR:** Azahar's configuration files contained several errors in hot‑key mappings and other settings, warranting a configuration reset.
**GENERAL:** Fixed spelling errors across several component‑ingredient files.
**PCSX2:** Corrected a `retrodeck/mods/pcsx2` folder‑path issue in the backup function.
**PICO‑8:** PICO‑8 is now looking in the correct path and is working again.
**PORTMASTER:** RetroDECK now sources the latest fix from the PortMaster team, which should resolve the current issues.
**RETROARCH:** Corrected a `retrodeck/bios/mame2003-plus` folder‑path issue in the backup function.

**Changed:**

- **ES-DE:** PrimeHack has been removed as an alternative emulator for GameCube and Wii, and now has its own PrimeHack system, linked to the `roms/primehack` folder.
