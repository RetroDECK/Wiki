## Thanks for your patience 

If you read the January blog post we are pushing the Godot Configurator to a later version to implement more feedback we have gotten both internally and from our testers.

We want to thank the community for being patient with waiting for the next update.

## New Lighter Manifest & Structure changes

We have spent several months rewriting how RetroDECK is built from the ground up. 

In doing so we have: 

- Reduced the application size with `600mb`. 
- Building RetroDECK went from 3.30 hours to about 1 hour. 
- Went from a monolithic build approach to a modular approach (each component is built separately and stitched together into RetroDECK).
- pre_build_automation script was reworked and additional functions have been added.
- RetroDECK now is migrated to an organization on GitHub that is hosting the new modular structure.

## Launch with RetroDECK (RetroENGINE)

RetroDECK can be used as an headless engine to run your games.

On the Linux Desktop (or desktop mode), we added the option to open and run various files directly with RetroDECK.

**Will RetroENGINE detect what system I want to launch?**

If you have the game file inside the corresponding roms/<system> folder RetroDECK will understand what system to launch. 

**Example:**

A  `.nes` file is inside the `retrodeck/roms/nes` folder. 

When you click on it, RetroDECK opens it with the Nintendo Entertainment System emulator, and the game starts. 

**What if it is not in the correct folder?**

When clicked, RetroDECK will prompt a dialog window asking which system the file belongs to and then run it.

##  Launch with games via CLI

You can also launch games directly via CLI with RetroENGINE.

Example syntax: 

`flatpak run net.retrodeck.retrodeck retrodeck/roms/<system>/<gamefile>` (`--help` for more information).

This feature have been requested by other developers in the community (or for those Linux Wizard Grognards that only want to use CLI for everything).

## Steam Rom Manager & Steam Sync

RetroDECK is now shipping with [Steam Rom Manager](https://steamgriddb.github.io/steam-rom-manager/) and the ability to Sync your games to Steam (Steam Sync) built-in. 

**What is Steam Rom Manager?**

**How does it work?**

**Notice: Flatpak Steam not yet supported**

We have not added support yet for Flatpak Steam.

## PortMaster

RetroDECK is now shipping with [PortMaster](https://portmaster.games/). 

**What is PortMaster?**

PortMaster is a simple GUI tool designed to facilitate the downloading and installation of game ports for Linux devices.

One of the goals of PortMaster is to not install or upgrade any existing OS libraries for any ports. Any of the ports that need a particular non-standard library are maintained within the ports' folder and made available specifically to that port during execution. 

**Note:** that not all 800+ ports are available for the X86_64 system, but the list keeps growing all the time.

### How does it work?

You go into the PortMaster menu in ES-DE and Open `PortMaster`. 

The application will auto update to the latest version and from there a library of ports will be shown. You go to a port and press the download button and it will downloaded and added to the ES-DE interface under the PortMaster menu.

**Note:** Some ports might require game files from purchased games from GOG, Steam or Physical Media to work. 

Check the [PortMaster Games List](https://portmaster.games/games.html) for details.

### Where are the files located?

## New RetroDECK ES-DE Theme

We got our the first version of our own RetroDECK ES-DE theme!

The theme is a remixed and inspired by the themes: Mini Banner made for Launchbox and ES-DE-Mini made for ES-DE.

The original themes Mini Banner and ES-DE-Mini are made by: `Weestuarty`, `DerSchlachter`, `Dan Patrick`.

The RetroDECK Theme features:

- Other types of sub-menus and layout.
- Icons for RetroDECK features like PortMaster.
- RetroDECK colors / graphics.
