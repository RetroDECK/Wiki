## Solarus TIPS

- Each game is its own self-contained game, and no overarching settings exist.
- Some games don't autostart in Fullscreen so you need to either `Select + West (X, Square)` or press ` CTRL + Enter`  or ` Alt + Enter`
- To quit games you need to press `Escape` that exists on in the radial menu system for the controllers.
