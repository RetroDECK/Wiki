**Fixed:**

- Obliterated decorative the Bullet Point Symbol • characters in prompts that had lists. It  caused issues on hybrid multilingual systems without a configured Flatpak languages or locale files. Those users could not access certain menus like **Open Component** (weird bug!). This culprit right here: (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻  • 
- Removed more unnecessary permissions in the net.retrodeck.retrodeck.yml. 
- Fixed an issue where some of the new paths (like retrodeck/storage) were being resolved prior to being set properly in finit. 

## Steam Input 

**Changed**

- **CONTROLLER LAYOUTS (ALL):** Changed **Full_Press** to **Long_Press** to reduce accidental hotkey presses. AKA you need to hold **SELECT** a bit longer to trigger the hotkeys. This change helps prevent unintended actions in games that require **SELECT** to be pressed in combination with other buttons. Increased all layout version numbers by **+0.1**. *Commits submitted by user: Lofter1*
