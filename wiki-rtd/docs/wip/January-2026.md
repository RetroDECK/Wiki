## Development Update: 0.11.0

We have begun development on the upcoming major update, **0.11.0**.  

This release is currently in active early development, with the team evaluating new features, improvements, and several unexpected things.

RetroDECK is a retro gaming platform not an "emulation platform". Our scope extends beyond emulation as that is just one part of RetroDECK. We are focusing on delivering a broader, more comprehensive retro gaming experience.

What follows are some of our experiments.

### Commander X16

Is a modern open source 8-bit computer inspired by classic systems, designed for retro-style development and learning.

It can be described as a “fantasy computer”, a reinterpretation of the Commodore 64.

### GameTank

In the contrast of Commander X16, GameTank is an open-source 8-bit game console built for homebrew development and education.

It can be described as a “fantasy console", a reinterpretation of the NES / Master System.

### MVEM

MVEM is a very very unkown emulator for the the Microvision, it was the first handheld console with interchangeable cartridges, released in 1979.

It was first developed by **Paul Robson** in 2014 and later enchanced by **Raph Koster** in 2017.

While some historical builds were produced for RetroPie ARM Linux by enthusiasts as an addon back in 2021. 

Neither of the old makefiles did not work in initial attempts of trying to build it, however, we later resolved the issues and successfully produced a working binary in a VM and got it to run in RetroDECK.

Controller support should not be expected, this little hidden gem was made for a keyboard.

This may be the first time MVEM has been bundled in a setup like ours on a x86_64 Linux environment. 

We are excited to bring it into RetroDECK, offering you access to this unique piece of hardware history.

## That is all for now 

There are more things we are working on, but you will see them in future blog updates!
