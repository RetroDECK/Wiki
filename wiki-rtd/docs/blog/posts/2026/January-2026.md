## The 0.10.0b Release - Aftermath

After ten months of work and more than 2,300+ commits, our first pull request to main was...coooool!

The internal discussions were intense within the team, and yes, our lead architect IceNine does deserve a raise.

We also did see a *bit* of a spike in downloads.

## Development Update

We continue to address post-release 0.10.0b issues through a series of minor patches. At this stage, we have no new announcements to share.

Due to the extensive nature of the MASSIVE rewrite update, some team members have been working really really really... hard. 

Some have sacrificed their entire Sunday on release day just to focus on bug fixes sitting by their computers from the early morning to late at night.

After the release, the same members clocked in on RetroDECK before work and again after getting home almost all week.

As a hobby project run by a small, passionate team of fewer than a handful, a tiny bit of brief respite is needed. 💜

Since no one on the team speaks German, we hope he had a pleasant time.

## Experiment Showcase: Rámon van Raaij's RetroDECK Console

[RetroDECK Console Experiment](https://ramon.vanraaij.eu/from-proxmox-node-to-retro-console-my-arch-linux-retrodeck-journey/)

Rámon conducted an experiment to create a RetroDECK console WITHOUT a desktop environment, launching directly into RetroDECK.

**Note:** This was done before the 0.10.0b rewrite patch and may no longer be accurate. We still think it's cool tho! Good job Rámon!

*"However, I want to be upfront. If you are starting fresh and just want to play games without the headache, you should probably just look into Batocera."*

*"But, if you are stubborn like me, or you specifically want to run RetroDeck on Arch Linux on older hardware without a full blown Desktop Environment, this guide is for you."*

//Rámon van Raaij
