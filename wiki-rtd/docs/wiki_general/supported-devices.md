RetroDECK was originally designed with the **Steam Deck** in mind. The project began as an effort to create a unified retro gaming platform for this device.

RetroDECK runs on standard **Linux desktop systems**, though its advanced hotkey functionality depends on **Steam Input** for full support.

For the best experience, we recommend using a distribution that includes a built-in “Game Mode,” such as **SteamOS**, **Bazzite**, **ChimeraOS**, or similar gaming-focused Linux distributions.
