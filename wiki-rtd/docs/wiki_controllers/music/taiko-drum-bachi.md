The Taiko Drum & Bachi controller is a specialized input device designed for playing Taiko no Tatsujin, a popular rhythm game series. The controller consists of a drum (taiko) and two drumsticks (bachi). Players use the drumsticks to hit the drum in time with the music, following the on-screen prompts. 

The drum is sensitive to different types of hits, allowing for a variety of drumming techniques to be used in the game. This controller provides an immersive and engaging experience, making players feel like they are playing a real taiko drum.
