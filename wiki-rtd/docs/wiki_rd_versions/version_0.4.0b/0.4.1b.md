**Release Date:** 2022-05-11

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

At the moment the emulator configs are reset during every update, this was made because every version may bring new configurations, please back them up if you did some manual configs.

**Emulators:**
            
- Tweaked various emulator configs.
- The emulators that was showing a small viewport like N64, Wii, GC, and Dreamcast are now showing a more appropriate viewport.
- Fixed home path in MelonDS (SA).
            
**ES-DE Frontend:**
            
- Updated ES-DE to 1.2.4
- RetroDECK doesn't open ES-DE anymore during the first setup, almost everything is now automated: HURRAY!
- Now a custom roms path can be selected if SD Card is selected and the SD Card is not found in the default path.
            
**Backend**:
            
- Fixed a bug where the folders where not symlinked correctly.
            
**Known Issues:**
            
- PCSX2: due to its limitation, the standalone PCSX2 doesn't have any way to set the hotkeys, so no save and load state, no quit button. In order to quit press: STEAM -> CLOSE WINDOW, be aware that the state is not automatically saved.
- External controllers and keyboard seems not to be working, expecially in the desktop mode.
- Yuzu makes RetroDECK freeze in some situations, like if the rom is a bad dump.
