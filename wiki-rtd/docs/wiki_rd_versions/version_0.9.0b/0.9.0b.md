If you read the announcement we are pushing the Godot Configurator to a later version to implement more feedback we have gotten both internally from team members and from our testers.

## New Lighter Manifest & Framework changes

We have spent several months rewriting how RetroDECK is built from the ground up with over a `1100+` commits since the last release. 

In doing so we have: 

- Reduced the application size around `600mb` (some of that space have been eaten with new features). 
- Building RetroDECK went from `3.30` hours to about `1` hour. 
- Went from a monolithic build approach to a modular approach (each component is built separately and stitched together into RetroDECK).
- RetroDECK now is migrated to an organization on GitHub that is hosting the new modular structure.
- Rebuilt the `pre_build_automation` script was reworked with additional features.
- Improved logging.
- Implemented changes for the future Godot version of the Configurator. 
- RetroDECK Framework can now pick up logged-in Steam profiles for systems like SRM.

## RetroENGINE - Run with RetroDECK

RetroDECK can be used as an headless engine to run your games.

On the Linux Desktop (or desktop mode) we added the option to associate / run / open various games directly with RetroDECK.

This also comes with the ability to launch the games via CLI.

This is feature is something that have been requested by the wider development community outside of RetroDECK (and maybe a few Linux Wizard Grognards that only want to use CLI for everything).

### What is PortMaster?


PortMaster is a simple GUI tool designed to facilitate the downloading and installation of game ports for Linux devices and is self contained.

One of the goals of PortMaster is to not install or upgrade any existing OS libraries for any ports. Any of the ports that need a particular non-standard library are maintained within the ports' folder and made available specifically to that port during execution. 

**Note:** 

That not all 800+ ports are available for the `X86_64` system, but the list keeps growing all the time.
