# Arcade Controllers

Arcade Controllers are used for playing arcade games, arcade-style games, or fighting games. They can be connected to USB and should work with RetroDECK if they have working udev/drivers and xinput.

**Always check for Linux Support**: Ensure there is Linux support before purchasing. Wireless Fight Sticks may require external configuration software.
