            <ul>
               <li>RetroDECK is on a diet: we saved around 600mb on the final build</li>
               <li>Updated all the possible outdated emulators</li>
               <li>Duckstation due to licensing changes is frozen at the latest possible build becoming de facto: Legacy</li>
               <li>Duckstation configured to use OpenGL as Vulkan seems to be broken in some cases</li>
               <li>Because of Steam Sync, Favorites collection is now enabled by default on ES-DE</li>
               <li>ES-DE Updated to 3.1.1 with language support and more</li>
               <li>ES-DE main menu tide up, because of our configurator there were too many entries, moved ES-DE specific configs inside a custom menu</li>
