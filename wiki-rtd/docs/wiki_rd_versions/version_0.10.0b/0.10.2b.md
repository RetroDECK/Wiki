## Components

**Fixed:**

- **AZAHAR:** Azahar’s configuration files contained several errors in hot‑key mappings and other settings, warranting a config reset.
- **PICO‑8:** PICO‑8 is now looking in the correct path and is working again.
- **PCSX2:** Corrected a retrodeck/mods/pcsx2 folder path issue in backup function. 
- **RetroArch:** Corrected a retrodeck/bios/mame2003-plus path issue in backup function. 

**Changed:**

- **ES‑DE:** PrimeHack has been removed as an alternative emulator for GameCube and Wii, and now has its own PrimeHack system, linked to the `roms/primehack` folder.
