# November 2024: Flashy winter

This month we will discuss

## Highlights

- New Website
- Merged


<!-- more -->

## New website

We secretly soft launched our new website during Halloween.

https://retrodeck.net/ 

Check it out and give feedback on the Discord on Lemmy. 

Thanks Adam Iannazzone for all his hard work on contributing his free time to the RetroDECK project and the new website. 

## 3DS Emulation - status

We had secret plans to include Lime3DS into the release of 0.9b. 

But the big Citra forks are merging into one,  it feels better to wait until they have sorted everything out and get the best release into RetroDECK proper. 

## Xenia - status

Instead of pulling in all of Wine into RetroDECK and configure it. We are looking into utilizing [UMU launcher](https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher) for Xenia instead and other Wine based systems in the future.

This feels like a better approach that can give more synergies.

We are waiting for the Open Wine Components Team (Heroic Game Launcher, Lutris, Bottles, Lutris, Proton-GE) to finish up their flatpak version firstly. 


## Merged Cooker

Several of the big feature branches are now merged into Cooker proper.


But the current cooker now features:

- SRM (Add to Steam)
- Godot Configurator
- Updated Emulators
- PortMaster
- Lighter Manifest

But having one big cooker now will make it easier to test everything in one go. 

NOTE: That not everything is working at the moment (including some systems). 

There is still  plenty of work to do.

## Development is a bit slower 

Please note that this is a big release with several features that requires coordination of several people that spends their free time doing this. 

It is a huge endeavor and we can't give any ETA's on when 0.9b will be released and done.

Everyone in FOSS have to always balance their commitment to free software and still do everything life entails.

We are looking into when the cooker is a bit more fleshed out and stable too maybe utilize the flathub-beta remote to facilitate easy testing.

## That is all for now

There are more things we are working on, but you will see them in future blog updates!

Thanks everyone!
