### KEX Engine - Getting the Downloaded bnetwads

**Prerequisite:** First, download the addons from the featured mods list.

Navigate from the `Main Menu` -> Select a game like DOOM II -> `Mods Menu` -> `Featured Mods`.

For some mods, you may need to click on `Mods Menu` -> `Browse` and search for them if they are no longer on the `Featured Mods` list to match the Unity Version set.

#### Where are the bnetwads located?

Each `.wad` downloaded has its own sub-folder based on an internal ID and contains the .wad file and an `index.json` file.

Opening the `index.json` file in each folder will tell you what game the `.wad` is.


**Example SIGILII in Steam:**

`~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/2280/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Saved Games/Nightdive Studios/DOOM/bnetwads/585d6a05-e50c-4ad7-aac7-726d35d23a50/`

Contains the `index.json` and `585d6a05-e50c-4ad7-aac7-726d35d23a50.wad`

Opening the `index.json`:


```
{
	"id" : "585d6a05-e50c-4ad7-aac7-726d35d23a50",      <-- Mod's BethestaNet ID
	"title" : "SIGIL II",                               <-- Mod Title
	"version" : "2ed265fd-6fdf-45a5-a078-35811549ce3b", <-- Current uploaded version (for updates)
	"wad" : "585d6a05-e50c-4ad7-aac7-726d35d23a50.wad"  <-- The Wad file
}

```

It reveals that `585d6a05-e50c-4ad7-aac7-726d35d23a50.wad` is in fact `SIGILII.WAD`.

You can then copy and paste it into `retrodeck/roms/doom/` and rename it to `SIGILII.WAD`.

The `bnetwad id` should tell you what the file is called and also where the file is located as the `bnetwad id` always match the contaning folders name.

#### How to extract them?

Each file is located in the `WADs/` folder from the step above with an ID number that you can check on the list.

**Example: Sigil**

Sigil has the ID of `4` and is then located in the `/WADs/4/` folder.

Within that folder there are images and also a file without an extension just called `4`.
That `4` file is the `SIGIL.WAD` file.

All you need to do is copy the ``/WADs/4/4` file to `retrodeck/roms/doom` then rename it `SIGIL.WAD`.


#### DOOM Unity Version - Extra: Windows tips

If you want to move the WADs from a Windows installations instead you can use this software:
[Unity Doom Ripper](https://github.com/kevansevans/Unity-Doom-Ripper)

The WADs are located in

`My Documents\Saved Games\id Software\DOOM 2\WADs\`

or

`My Documents\Saved Games\id Software\DOOM Classic\WADs\`

Then just transfer them with a USB Stick or another way to your Linux machine.
