# RetroDECK 0.8.4b

**Release date:** 2024-08-13

## Information

We fixed several issues with downloaded scraped data not showing up in ES-DE.

For some users the scraped data was not moved correctly over to the subfolder `retrodeck/ES-DE/` in the older 0.8.X patches.

These issues were caused by the old manifest structure and certain Zenity prompts. <br>
We will be moving away from Zenity and are making a brand new RetroDECK manifest in 0.9.0b (MORE ON THAT LATER).

### How will this patch work?

When you upgrade RetroDECK will check if the folders `downloaded_media` and `themes` still exists under the `retrodeck/` folder.

It will also check so the symlinks for `gamelists` and `collections` are correct and if not update them.

It will check the `es_settings` have the correct filepaths for the `retrodeck/ES-DE/` folders and if not update the values.

**If themes & downloaded_media still exist in retrodeck/:**

The folders will be moved into `retrodeck/ES-DE/`.

**If duplicate folders exists:**

If the folders exist at both places: `retrodeck/` and `retrodeck/ES-DE/` the folders from `retrodeck/` will be merged into the folders under the `downloaded_media` and `themes` in `retrodeck/ES-DE/`.

##  RetroDECK Framework / Backend:

**Fixed:**

- Folders were not correctly placed and moved from `retrodeck/` to the new folder structure under the `retrodeck/ES-DE/` in some scenarios for users causing the ES-DE data to be not found by ES-DE.

- String values of es_settings were not updated for `MediaDirectory` and `UserThemeDirectory` in some scenarios for users causing the ES-DE data to be not found by ES-DE.

- On new installations two folders could be created for scraped data, for example: one `downloaded_media` under `retrodeck/` and one under `retrodeck/ES-DE/`.

**Added**

- Post-update CLI trigger command for debugging.
