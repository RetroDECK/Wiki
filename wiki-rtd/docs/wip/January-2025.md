## The bad news - Moving Godot Configurator

We are also postponing the release of the Godot Configurator to a later major version to incorporate valuable feedback from both our team members and testers. 

As we already delayed 0.9.0b long enough, we decided to move the Godot Configurator to a future version.

## The good news - 0.9.0 Captain Comeback soon!

The good news is then that 0.9.0b is coming very soon.

We are in fact in the final stages of testing with the community testers squashing minor bugs and tweaking things.

If you want to help out the testing effort go to the ðŸ’™-i-want-to-help channel on Discord.


## That is all for now 

There are more things we are working on, but you will see them in future blog updates!
  
Thanks everyone!
