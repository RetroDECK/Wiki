### External Controller Issues - GZDOOM

GZDOOM have some kind of conflict with Steam Input in when more then one controller that causes input looping in menus. Make sure that the controller you are using is set as Player 1 else use Reorder Controllers interface in Steam to make it Player 1.

We are still investigation the cause of it, if you know of a solution please contact the RetroDECK Team.

## Ponzu (Legacy AppImage Loader)

Ponzu is in part the former Yuzu (Custom) AppImage Loader and tool that we had planned for 0.8.0b. If the user has personal backups of the last versions of the now dead emulators in AppImage format they can temporarily be used with RetroDECK as-is.

https://retrodeck.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wiki_configurator/ponzu/

### Q: Should this be seen as official support for the removed emulators?

No, the only official and supported defaults are Ryujinx and Citra-core in RetroArch.

RetroDECK will not provide any new: configs, bug fixes, improvements or support towards the AppImages. There is also a risk that future updates can break the compatibility with the AppImages (because they are no longer maintained and dead), this is a as-is solution.

We strongly recommenced everyone to just use Ponzu as a way to safely migrate to Ryujinx or the Citra-core (save and move).

### Q: Will you be looking in into other forks of Citra & Yuzu later and add into RetroDECK?

First, this type of event makes it ripe for scammers.

We would urge all users to be extra careful and not blindly downloading everything you see on the internet including fan fixes for the dead emulators.

If good, safe and ethical forks arises that have been vetted by the FOSS community...we will look into it.

## New RetroDECK Steam Input Layout: Steam Deck - Simple

This is a new layout for the Steam Deck with a lighter radial menu on the left touchpad. Some users did not want to have the full radial menu system but would rather just have something more simple.

The layout is called `RetroDECK: Steam Deck - Neptune v.1b SIMPLE`

LINK HERE TO WIKI

---

## Updated RetroDECK Steam Input Layout: Steam Deck - Full

Several changes have been made to old layout

```
Change: Renamed layout to RetroDECK: Steam Deck - Neptune v.1b FULL
Change: Version number standardization.
Change: MAME Menu - Changed all the binds to reflect new MAME (Standalone) config.
Added: Wii/GC Menu - Wii Mote Sync 1 to 4 buttons.
Added: Wii/GC Menu - New icons to Wii Mote Standing / Laying buttons.
Added: MAME Menu - Added Tilt 1 to 4 buttons.
Added: GZDoom Menu
Added: ScummVM Menu
Removed: Secrets Menu
```

### New Radial Menu: SCUMMVM Menu

A new SCUMMVM Menu allows quick access to common commands used by a big chunk of the SCUMMVM games.

The design intent is that when you are playing a SCUMMVM game on the Steam Deck. You can have the SCUMMVM menu open on the left touchpad while you use the mouse on the right touchpad to navigate the game.

The following commands are available:


```
Open - O
Close - C
Fight - F
Use - U
Pick-up - P
Push/Shove - S
Pull/Yank - Y
Look-At - L
Talk To - T
Give - G
Move - M
```

### New Radial Menu: GZDoom Menu

This menu is a tiny showcase on what is possible with radial menus, we also wanted to add other famous cheats like the Konami Code on a button but... <br>
A bug in Steam Input prevents us from add more cheats the two we have added (the RetroDECK Team have reported the bug to Valve).

The following commands are available:

```
Get All Items
Get All Items + Keys
```

## New RetroDECK Steam Input Layouts: External Controllers

All controller layouts uses the same one layer radial menu with good to have hotkeys in addition to the normal button hotkeys. To access the radial menu press and hold SELECT + Move the Left Joystick and Press L3 to press the radial button.

### Might work on more devices

We have also gotten user reports that these layouts work on devices that simulates certain controllers via Steam Input like the Lenovo Legion Go. The devices will pickup one the layout it is mimicing if it is a DualSense or Xbox Wireless and allow hotkeys to be used on that device.

The RetroDECK Team does not own these devices and we can not test them ourself, but if you discover something you can report to the RetroDECK Team on Discord or Matrix.

### What does the External Controller layouts allow me to do?

The Radial menu quick access for various good to have PC commands like ESC, F1, Enter but also Screen Switching on Dual Screen Emulators or Change Discs. The intent is to use the button combos as the main input for the important hotkeys like saving and loading.

One other important feature is press and hold SELECT and move Right Stick and it will work as Mouse with R3 as Left Click and L3 as Right Click. This can be extremely useful:

- Navigating emulator GUIs.
- Close a pop-up window.
- Use the Wii Pointer
- Playing point and click or just PC games.


### The RetroDECK external controller radial menu

This menu is used on all controllers by pressing by pressing and holding SELCT + Moving the Left Joystick.
It features a variety of PC commands and other commands that are good to have. While the most important commands are bound to the normal button combos.

### Known Issues: External Controllers - Steam Deck

Sometimes the emulators / engines gets confused on what controller is player 1 and takes the docked Steam Deck as player 1 and not the external contrller.

You can solve this by going into the Reorder Controllers interface in Steam and try switching between Player 1 or Player 2.

### Known Issues: External Controllers - Linux Desktop

Linux Desktop via Steam Input is complex. There are a lot of variables and the RetroDECK Team don't have the ability to test for all of them:

- What kind of packages are installed.
- What kind of drivers you have installed.
- What distro you are using.
- What desktop you are using.
- If you are running X11 or Wayland.
- If you have a Steam Deck based Distro with Valves "Game Mode".

We are trying to keep track of all the issues here and have reported several to Valve:

https://github.com/XargonWan/RetroDECK/issues/716

**Bug: Destop Profiles take preset over Game Profile**

Since the one of the recent Steam Client updates, there is a bug that causes Steam to take the Desktop Profile instead of the Game Profile. Sometimes it even takes both inputs and sends double inputs for every action.

Possible solutions by our users and team members:

- Try and use the RetroDECK Profile as the Desktop Profile and turning off the Game Profile.
- Going into big picture and launching RetroDECK from there.
- Starting big picture, exiting big picture and then launching RetroDECK from the Desktop Client.

**Bug: Missing Radials in certain systems**

The radial menus on certain Linux Systems are hidden behind the game window or the Steam overlay (they still work and you can navigate them).

We thought about doing a temporary none radial layouts for each controller to get around this bug.<br>
But later changed our minds as we would have even more input configs to maintain, with a risk they become permanent.

## Questions

### HEY YOU?! RetroDECK Team where is the add to Steam Function?! 👿

With the focus of both removing Yuzu and Citra from RetroDECK + implementing ES-DE 3.0 changes it needed to be pushed back. Hopefully we can add it a minor update like 0.8.X. We got a few bugs we need to fix with the BoliR developer.

### What about the Multiuser Mode?! 👿

That still needed more time in the oven for the complexity of it and we will put it out in another big version. This update is already quite big!
