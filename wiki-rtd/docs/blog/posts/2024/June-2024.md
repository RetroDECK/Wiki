## 0.8.2b soonish

We hope to release 0.8.2b with bugfixes and emulators/engines/es-de updates "soonish".

We have had several `New Helper 👷` submit commits and we are grateful for them and hope to review them as soon as possible.

If you want to help with parts of development please contact us on `Matrix` or post in the `💙-i-want-to-help` channel on `Discord`.

## NetPlay/Online experiments

<img src="../../../netplay.webp">

This is just an experiment of an Online play function we are working on, with the goal of providing a unified online play tool across all the engines / emulators.

We are looking into the ability to pipe all online services into this function:

- RetroArch Netplay
- Pretendo
- Dolphin Rooms
- PCSX2 Rooms
- and more

The screenshot is just a POC of the function and we hope to ship it with a nice Godot interface like the upcoming configurator or as part of the configurator (we have not decided yet) .

## 0.9.0b

The work on the next major version has already begun and it will take time before it is released.

There are many features planned for 0.9.0b and we will keep talking about them in future blogposts.

### Ruffle

`New Helper 👷` MonkeyX have made progress of integrating the Flash Emulator Ruffle into RetroDECK and the goal is to ship is as a part of 0.9.0b.


### Upgraded QT Package

Dolphin and Primehack had some issues that prevented us from updating to the latest freedesktop QT Package, those have now been fixed (look at the shutout we gave in the May blogpost). As part of the 0.9.0b we will be upgrading to the latest version.

## Summertime

Summer is here and several people on the RetroDECK team will be quite busy with vacation, travel and a myriad of other summer activities.

That means:

- There is a potential that we will not be as active on Discord/Matrix.
- Some parts of development could be slower.
- We will not publish any new blogposts until September.

☀️ We wish everyone a happy summer! ☀️


## That is all for now

Thanks everyone!
