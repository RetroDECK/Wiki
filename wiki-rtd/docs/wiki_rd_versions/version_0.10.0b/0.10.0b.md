## Rewrote Everything from the Ground Up  

Over **1 500+** commits later, the changes are too extensive for line‑by‑line patch notes, so here’s a high‑level overview:


### Core Architecture

<img src="../../../wiki_icons/retrodeck/icon-framework.svg" width="75">


- Completely rebuilt how all components interact within RetroDECK and RetroDECK itself. 
- Overhauled the entire build pipeline. 
- Upgraded to org.kde.platform 6.10.


### Permissions & Security

- Refactored the `net.retrodeck.retrodeck.yml` configuration file for clearer structure, easier maintenance and made it oh so pretty.
- Significantly reduced the default permissions granted to the RetroDECK application.
- Added granular, purpose‑driven permission sets with explicit rationales for each in the `net.retrodeck.retrodeck.yml`.



### RetroDECK Alchemist & The Component System

<img src="../../../wiki_icons/retrodeck/icon-alchemist.svg" width="75"> <img src="../../../wiki_icons/retrodeck/icon-assembler.svg" width="75">



- Made a modular component system where each component is isolated in it's own sub‑sandbox.
- Each component is defined and sourced via a component recipe file and various component ingredient files.
- Redesigned library and dependency handling, ensuring each component pulls only what it needs.


### RetroDECK API

**Flips** (Floating IPS) is a lightweight, cross‑platform patcher that supports both **IPS** and **BPS** patch formats for ROMHacks. 

It allows users to apply, create, and verify patches for ROMs and other binary files.

## New Features


### Added: Lahrs Folder Icons & Iconsets

*New folder icons created by RetroDECK team member **Lahrs***  

- Added tools to **remove** or **re‑add** the icons via the configurator.  
- Added a framework for future icon‑set swaps if the community contributes new sets.  


---


### Added: Storage directory

A new `retrodeck/storage` directory serves as a catch‑all location for miscellaneous data we want to expose to users in a more accessible way.  

> *Current release*: Only a few items are exposed, but we plan to migrate additional data from internal Flatpak locations in upcoming updates.  

**What type of Data are you thinking about?**

- DLC / Patches 
- None Saves HDD Space
- Future DOS emulator – environments for installed: Windows 3.1, 95, 98.
- Assets – quick access to things like FM banks, soundfonts (for G​ZDoom) and DAT files, GameOver screens etc.. (for MAME).  
- Other

<img src="../../../wiki_images/logos/es-de-logo.png" width="100">

We only list the RetroDECK specific changes here, check the full: [ES-DE: Changelog](https://gitlab.com/es-de/emulationstation-de/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

**Note:** 

- The **ES‑DE: Game Importer** function (e.g., importing Steam games and such) does not work with RetroDECK and has been disabled.

**Changes:** 

- Several folders have been hidden because they aren't supported in RetroDECK (e.g., `Lutris`, `Epic`, `Windows`, and others) to avoid confusion.  
- The `Desktop` folder remains available for various community tinkering experiments.


**Added:** 

- In `es_find_rules.xml`, the `<emulator name="FLATPAKSPAWN">` has been added, making it easier for users who want to tinker with RetroDECK and break out of the sandbox.
- The RetroDECK Theme has been updated with all the new features of ES-DE 3.4.0 such as Played Time.

**Fixed:** 

- A number of alternative emulators that were mistakenly displayed, though unavailable in RetroDECK have now been hidden.

**Known Issue:** 

- The **ES‑DE Configurations** submenu in RetroDECK's ES‑DE does not yet support translations. Translation support is planned for a future release.
