## The Factions

### The Murican Cheese Crust Patriots - MCCP

Patriotic Americans that try to crush the opposition with infinite pepperoni and cheese.

*"The Italian American immigrants took Pizza to the US and made it better thanks to freedom. Are we not free to put as much pepperoni as we want? How about Mozzarella or bread sticks? Is there an upper limit? We say no there is not! The symbol of newfound freedom of the Italian Americans is not the cheese filled crusts? All these innovations were made thanks to being free."*.


### The Nordic Pizza Cult - NPC

Label as Heretics by the others for their dark pizza magicks.

*"The Italians and Americans are weak, the do not dare to take Pizza beyond their set fake borders and rules. Here in the cold north, we have learned and now know the truth... there are no borders. Pizza is an empty canvas; it can be painted into whatever chaotic image of food perfection we desire!"*.
