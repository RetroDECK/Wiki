## How-to: Create .scummvm files that run in ES-DE

This guide works for both the  `ScummVM-SA` and `ScummVM RetroArch Core`.

**Example:** 

In this example we got a game we want to add: `Beneath a Steel Sky`.

### Step 1: Add the game

Move the uncompressed game into the `retrodeck/roms/scummvm/` folder.

The result should be: `retrodeck/roms/scummvm/Beneath a Steel Sky/`

### Step 2: Rename the folder

Rename and add `.scummvm` at the end of the folder name.

Result:

`retrodeck/roms/scummvm/Beneath a Steel Sky.scummvm/`

### Step 3: Create the .scummvm file

- The `.scummvm` file starts as a empty textfile that needs to be created in the games folder.
- It should be named `<GameName>.scummvm`
- In our example the file will be called `Beneath a Steel Sky.scummvm` and should be created in `retrodeck/roms/scummvm/Beneath a Steel Sky.scummvm/`

The filename should have the same name as the folder.

The end result should look like:

`retrodeck/roms/scummvm/Beneath a Steel Sky.scummvm/Beneath a Steel Sky.scummvm`

### Step 4: Check the ScummVM ID of the game

Go into [ScummVM Game Compatibility and ID List](https://www.scummvm.org/compatibility)

Search for `Beneath a Steel Sky` make a note of the `ScummVM ID` in this case called: `sky`

### Step 5: Open the .scummvm file and add the ScummVM ID

Open up the empty `Beneath a Steel Sky.scummvm` file and just type in the `ScummVV ID` in the first row of the file and save in this example `sky`. 

Make sure you don't add any spaces or linebreaks and the file should just contain the word `sky`.

### Step 6: The game should now run

The game should now be launchable in the ES-DE interface.
