# Guide: Using Real Wii Remotes in Dolphin

**Tip:** Sync Wiimote Button Hotkey

RetroDECK has a built-in hotkey for pressing the Dolphin `Sync Wiimote` button (`Alt + W`) if you get disconnected in Steam Input. It can also be accessed from some controller's radial menu systems.

## Hardware Prerequisites

- A Wii Sensor Bar alternative (wireless or wired).
- A Linux compatible Bluetooth dongle or built-in Bluetooth adapter.

### Mod: Wii bluetooth adapter to USB

For hardware mod enthusiasts, you can buy a Bluetooth adapter spare part from a Wii console and wire it as a USB Bluetooth adapter for better compatibility.

## Information: Third Party Wii Remotes

Many third party Wii Remotes lack native Linux support, but several groups are working on it. 

- They may work with Bluetooth Passthrough mode in Dolphin.
- They may or may not remember pairing with the Bluetooth adapter, requiring synchronization for each game.

## Steam Deck Tips: Real Wii Remotes

- Play docked, connected to a monitor/TV, with a separate Bluetooth dongle attached to the dock.
- Set a sudo password for the Steam Deck.
- Connect a keyboard/mouse to the dock while setting up.
- Sit close to the Steam Deck when pairing the Wiimotes.
- Configure Wiimotes in `Desktop Mode` first, then switch to `Game Mode` when everything is working.

    - Open Dolphin from the Configurator.
    - Make all the settings changes to connect the Wiimotes.
    - Launch a game from `Desktop Mode` directly in Dolphin.
    - If pairing works and the Wiimotes connect and control the game fine in `Desktop Mode`, it will work in `Game Mode` when launched from RetroDECK.

## How-to: Use a Real Wii Remote - Method 1: Emulate Wii's Bluetooth Adapter

This method works only with the Official Wii Remote controller and is the easiest method.

### Step 1: Open Dolphins Controller Settings

<img src="../emulated-bluetooth.png" width="450">

Open `RetroDECK Configurator` -> `Open Emulator` -> `Dolphin` -> `Options` -> `Controller Settings`.


### Step 2: Change the Settings

Under `Emulate the Wii's Bluetooth adapter`:

- Change the values of Wii Remote dropdown lists from `Emulated Wii Remote` to `Real Wii Remote`.
- Enable the following checkboxes:
  - `Connect Wii Remotes for Emulated Controllers`
  - `Continuous Scanning`

### Step 3: Syncing the Wiimotes

- Connect the Wiimote by pressing the `Sync Button` when a game is launched.
- Reconnect every time when launching a new game. 
- If everything works, re-pairing should be quick with the press of the `A` button without needing to press the `Sync Button` again.

## How-to: Use a Real Wii Remote - Method 2: Bluetooth Passthrough

This method works with both 3rd party and official Wiimotes. It is more complex and has some downsides.

**ðŸ›‘ Warning ðŸ›‘**

- This method makes the Bluetooth adapter unusable for other devices while playing Wii games. 
- No other devices can connect to it except Wiimotes, meaning all other devices will disconnect. 
- It is recommended to have a backup input method like a wireless keyboard or a controller with a dongle/cable.

### Step 1: Find Your Vendor and Product IDs

First you need to find our your `Vendor ID` `Product ID` for the Bluetooth adapter you want to use.

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Type `lsusb`.
3. It will display all connected USB or BUS devices.

**Example:**

```
Bus 001 Device 003: ID 0bda:5650 Realtek Semiconductor Corp.
Bus 001 Device 004: ID 8087:0025 Intel Corp. Wireless-AC 9260 Bluetooth Adapter
```

`ID 8087:0025 Intel Corp. Wireless-AC 9260 Bluetooth Adapter` is the Bluetooth Adapter in this example. The `ID 8087:0025` left value is the `Vendor ID` while the right is `Product ID`. In this example: `Vendor ID` is `8087` and `Product ID` is `0025`.


### Step 2: Create the rules file

You will need root privileges for this.


1. Open a terminal and type the following command, replacing `Vendor ID` and `Product ID` respectively:

```
sudo echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="Vendor ID", ATTRS{idProduct}=="Product ID", TAG+="uaccess"' | sudo tee -a /etc/udev/rules.d/52-dolphin.rules > /dev/null
```

From the example above, the result should look like this:

```
sudo echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="8087", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0025", TAG+="uaccess"' | sudo tee -a /etc/udev/rules.d/52-dolphin.rules > /dev/null
```

2. Reload udev rules with: sudo udevadm control --reload-rules.
3. Take out and reinsert the Bluetooth adapter or reboot if a built-in was used.

### Step 3: Enable Bluetooth Passthrough in Dolphin

Open `RetroDECK Configurator` -> `Open Emulator` -> `Dolphin` -> `Options` -> `Controller Settings`.

Change Bluetooth type:

- From `Emulate the Wii's Bluetooth adapter` to `Passthrough a Bluetooth Adapter`

Enable the following checkboxes:

<img src="../dolphin-connect-scan.png" width="450">

- `Connect Wii Remotes for Emulated Controllers`
- `Continuous Scanning`

### Step 4: Syncing the Wiimotes

- Connect the Wiimote when a game is launched.
- Reconnect every time when launching a new game.
- Press `1` and `2` together on the Wiimote or the `Sync Button` (under the backplate) when launching a game.
- Sometimes, press the `Sync Button` on the Emulated Wii in the Dolphin Interface. RetroDECK has a built-in shortcut for this (`Alt + W`), accessible from the Steam Input Radial Menu system.

### Extra: Troubleshooting and Tips

- Sit close to the device during initial pairing.
- Pairing may take a while, especially with third-party Wiimotes. Try multiple times with the `Sync Button` + `Sync Wiimote`.
- To play with normal controllers again, change back to `Emulate the Wii's Bluetooth adapter` setting and `Emulated Wii Remote`.
- If the udev rules created in Step 2 are incorrect and Dolphin cannot get Bluetooth access, it will display an error message and crash. Ensure the file in `/etc/udev/rules.d/52-dolphin.rules` and its content are correct.
