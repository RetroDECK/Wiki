## Steam Sync 2.0

Steam Sync Version 2.0 is here! This is the next step in the Steam Sync function we launched with 0.9.0b.

It now supports two Sync Modes and has a complimentary troubleshooting purge tool as well:

- **Automatic Steam Sync**: Sync ES-DE favorites to Steam automatically when RetroDECK quits. You can enable or disable this feature.

- **Manual Steam Sync**: Perform a one-time manual sync of ES-DE favorites to Steam whenever you want.

- **New Tool: Purge Steam Sync Shortcuts**: This tool performs a full Steam ROM Manager purge of all favorites in Steam (in case things have gotten messed up).

The new version is also **much faster and smarter** than before.

## Backup RetroDECK Tool 2.0

The new version of the Backup RetroDECK tool offers more backup options and is significantly faster. It includes three types of backups:

- **Core Backup**: Backs up only essential files, such as saves, states, and gamelists.

- **Custom Backup**: Allows you to select specific folders to back up.

- **Complete Backup**: Backs up all data, including games and downloaded media.

Additionally, the Backup RetroDECK tool will now prompt users to perform a backup before upgrading RetroDECK to a new version.

## Compression Tool Improvements 

The Compression RetroDECK tool has significantly improved its speed by utilizing the system's CPU cores more efficiently. In some cases, the speed increase has been up between 100-400%, depending on the hardware.

## New Tool: Repair Paths

If your RetroDECK folder has gotten lost, this function repairs RetroDECK paths without needing a full reset.

It will automatically attempt to fix and look for common RetroDECK paths. 

If RetroDECK can't be found, it will ask the user to specify the location.

## New Tool: Logging Level Changer

This tool lets you control how much information is logged in `retrodeck/logs`.

There are four levels:

- **Level 1: Informational**: The default setting, logs only basic important information.
- **Level 2: Warnings**: Logs general warnings.
- **Level 3: Errors**: Logs more detailed error messages.
- **Level 4: Debug**: Logs everything, which may generate a lot of logs.

In the stable version of RetroDECK, the default is **Level 1: Default**.

In the unstable cooker builds, the default is **Level 4: Debug**.
