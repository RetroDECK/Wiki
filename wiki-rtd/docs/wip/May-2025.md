## MORE! RetroDECK Experiments ‚öóÔ∏è on the Wiki

Our goal with the experiments section on the wiki we added in back in March was to expose various community tinkers experiments that we know existed into one place. 

Sometimes it is very hard to find those tinkering projects that are way out of scope as they might be on forums, social media, reddit/lemmy or other places. 

We in the RetroDECK Team are incredibly happy to document, expand and see your efforts on what is possible then you break a few things and think outside of the box. 

Now let's present the experiments so far!

### Disclaimer on Experiments

These experiments are created by the RetroDECK Team and/or Community. The guides are intended for people with technical knowledge and a passion for tinkering. Using these guides might put RetroDECK and your data at risk. The RetroDECK Team can't provide any support for these experiments or fix any issues they might cause on your system or RetroDECK installation.

## Experiment: Autoboot into RetroDECK and not Game Mode

This experiment was initiated by the user Daeymon, then later expanded upon by the RetroDECK Team. Daeymon goal was to explore the possibility of autobooting into RetroDECK when the Steam Deck's Game Mode is launched directly and not into the Steam Game Mode UI.

## Experiment: RetroDECK ES-DE Background Music

This experiment was initiated by the users **Partack** and **TopHatCat**, then later expanded upon by the RetroDECK Team. The goal was to explore the possibility of doing custom scripts to enable very basic music playback in ES-DE.

## Experiment: Launching External Emulators

This experiment was initiated by the user **TopHatCat** and later expanded upon by the RetroDECK Team. TopHatCats goal was to explore the possibility of launching games against external Emulators from within RetroDECK (limited to the systems ES-DE supports).

**However, doing this defeats the entire purpose of RetroDECK!** 

Essentially, you are creating an Anti-RetroDECK / Bizzaro-RetroDECK / Absolute Heresy inside of RetroDECK.

## Experiment: Run RetroDECK in WSL on Windows 11

This experiment was initiated by a stupid idea in the RetroDECK Team.

**Note:** RetroDECK was never intended to be used in this manner and the performance is horrible.
