**Spyro's Adventure Portal**

The Spyro's Adventure portal was the first portal introduced in the Skylanders series. It is a wireless portal that uses 4 AA batteries for power and requires a special USB attachment to be plugged into the console for wireless functionality. The portal has a small ring of green-colored plastic near the bottom, matching the green base color of Spyro's Adventure figures. It is intended for use with the game **Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure**, which was released on October 16, 2011[1](https://office.com?path='6706cc33-8cab-4d29-9080-f087c58b3ce8').

**Giants Portal**

The Giants portal looks very similar to the Spyro's Adventure portal but uses a wired USB connection instead of wireless. Since it is a wired device, it does not require batteries and lacks a battery compartment. The ring near the bottom of the portal is clear/gray rather than green, and the glyphs on the side of the portal are a darker color. It is intended for use with the game **Skylanders: Giants**, which was released on October 21, 2012[2](https://office.com?path='a9e2ff64-845d-4c27-af8d-14a745a3d349').

**Swap Force Portal**

The Swap Force portal is about half the height of the portals from the first two games. It features a more compact design and is also a wired USB device. It is intended for use with the game **Skylanders: Swap Force**, which was released on October 13, 2013.

**Trap Team Portal**

The Trap Team portal is visibly distinct from the previous portals. It includes a slot for placing Traps, which are used to capture and summon villains in the game. This portal is also a wired USB device. It is intended for use with the game **Skylanders: Trap Team**, which was released on October 5, 2014.

**SuperChargers Portal**

The SuperChargers portal is similar in design to the Trap Team portal but includes additional features to support the new vehicle-based gameplay introduced in SuperChargers. It is also a wired USB device. It is intended for use with the game **Skylanders: SuperChargers**, which was released on September 20, 2015.

**Imaginators Portal**

The Imaginators portal is the most versatile of all the portals, compatible with multiple games and systems. It is a wired USB device and supports the creation and customization of Skylanders characters. It is intended for use with the game **Skylanders: Imaginators**, which was released on October 16, 2016.
