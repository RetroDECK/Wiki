## New Lighter Manifest & Framework changes

We have spent several months rewriting various aspects of RetroDECK, resulting in about `1300` commits since the last release. During this time, we have:

- Reduced the application size by around `600MB`.
- Decreased the build time from `3.30` hours to about `1` hour.
- Transitioned from a monolithic build approach to a modular one, where each component is built separately and then integrated into RetroDECK.
- Migrated RetroDECK to an organization on GitHub, which now hosts the new modular structure.
- Reworked the `pre_build_automation script`, adding new features.
- Improved logging.
- Implemented changes for the future Godot version of the Configurator.
- Enabled the RetroDECK Framework to pick up logged-in Steam profiles for systems like SRM.

This work will also continue in upcoming major updates, as we want to make the build system more dynamic and easy.

## RetroENGINE - Run with RetroDECK

<img src="../../../wiki_images/systems/retroengine/re-appselect.png" width="500"> 

RetroDECK can be used as a headless engine to run your games. 

On the Linux Desktop (or desktop mode), we have added the option to associate, run, and open various game files directly with RetroDECK. 

This also includes the ability to launch games via the CLI.

This feature has been requested by the wider development community outside of RetroDECK (and maybe a few Linux Wizard Grognards that only want to use CLI for everything).

We can't wait to see what other developers do with it.

**Quote from Discord User:**

*"Whoa! That is a lot of text for saying you can now double click on game files and they open"*

RetroDECK is now shipping with [Steam Rom Manager](https://steamgriddb.github.io/steam-rom-manager/) and the ability to Sync your games to Steam aka `Steam Sync` built-in. 

**Notice: Flatpak Steam Not Yet Supported**

We have not yet added support for the Flatpak version of Steam.


**What is Steam Rom Manager?**

Steam ROM Manager is a bulk game importer and artwork manager for Steam.

It adds separate games to Steam, incorporates artwork from [SteamGridDB](https://www.steamgriddb.com/) , and configures the RetroDECK Steam Input layouts.

### What is PortMaster?


PortMaster is a simple GUI tool designed to facilitate the downloading and installation of game ports for Linux devices and is self contained.

One of the goals of PortMaster is to not install or upgrade any existing OS libraries for any ports. Any of the ports that need a particular non-standard library are maintained within the ports' folder and made available specifically to that port during execution.

## New RetroDECK ES-DE Theme

We got our the first version of our own RetroDECK ES-DE theme!

The theme is inspired by the themes: Mini Banner made for Launchbox and ES-DE-Mini made for ES-DE. 

The original themes Mini Banner and ES-DE-Mini are made by: `Weestuarty`, `DerSchlachter` and `Dan Patrick`.

It could be seen as a RetroDECK Remix of those themes.

The RetroDECK Theme features:

- Other types of sub-menus and layout.
- Icons for RetroDECK features like PortMaster.
- RetroDECK colors / graphics.
