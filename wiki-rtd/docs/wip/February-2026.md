## Development Update: 0.11.0

We have begun development on the upcoming major update, **0.11.0**.

This release is currently in active early development, with the team evaluating new features, improvements and several unexpected things.

RetroDECK is a **Retro Gaming Platform** not an *Emulation Platform*. Our scope extends beyond emulation as that is just one tiny part of RetroDECK. We are focusing on delivering a broader, more comprehensive retro gaming experience.

What follows are some of our early experiments. As always, we can't guarantee that everything shown here will make it into version 0.11.0, as development is still at a very early stage.

## Commander X16

Is a modern open source 8-bit computer inspired by classic systems, designed for retro-style development and learning.

It can be described as a “fantasy computer”, a reinterpretation of the Commodore 64.

The project sells physical hardware for purchase and an offers an official emulator that we are testing.

## GameTank

GameTank is an open-source 8-bit game console built for homebrew development and education.

It can be described as a “fantasy console", a reinterpretation of the NES / Master System.

The project sells physical hardware for purchase and an offers an official emulator that we are testing.

*Déjà vu*

## MVEM (MicroVision EMulator)

*MVEM running in RetroDECK*

MVEM is a very very very... unknown emulator for the Milton Bradley Microvision, it was the first handheld console with interchangeable cartridges, released in 1979 with a resolution of: **16x16** px.

The Gameboy released 10 years later in 1989 that had a resolution of: **160x144** px.

The emulator was first developed by **Paul Robson** back in 2014 and later enchanced by **Raph Koster** in 2017.

Some historical builds were produced for RetroPie Linux ARM by enthusiasts as an none official addon back in 2021. 

Neither of the old makefiles did not work in initial attempts of trying to build it, however, we later resolved the issues with some elbow grease and successfully produced a working binary in a VM and got it to run in RetroDECK.

This may be the first time MVEM has been bundled in a setup like ours on a Linux x64 environment? Or? We don't know... anyhow... 

We are excited to bring it into RetroDECK, offering you access to this unique piece of hardware history.

Good controller support should not be expected, this little hidden gem emulator was made for a keyboard.

## Visual Pinball X

*Mr.Bubble fan game running in RetroDECK*

Visual Pinball X (VPX) is a virtual pinball engine designed to accurately simulate real-world pinball tables with advanced physics, lighting, and scripting support.

The RetroDECK team is looking for community contributions and expertise in configuring **VPinballX.ini** for:

- Steam Deck and other Linux-based handheld devices
- Linux desktop systems
- Linux-powered virtual pinball machines (LVPs)

If you have that experience please contact us and see if we can make a global configuration (if possible).

## Mudlet

Mudlet will be the first client-type component added to RetroDECK. A client is a system or application that connects to a server or online service to access multiplayer features, streaming, or remote content. Clients rely on an external host to function.

A powerful MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) client that connects players to text-based online multiplayer games, the precursors to modern MMOs.

Enabling server maintainers to add visual elements and custom features and allowing players to script, automate, and fully customize their gameplay experience.

You'll be able to connect using our new `.mud` files and that are tied to server profiles, with all `.mud`  and server specific files stored in `retrodeck/roms/muds/`.

## That is all for now 

There are more things we are working on, but you will see them in future blog updates!

And as always if you want to help with development join the 💙-i-want-to-help channel on Discord.

Thank you to everyone for your continued support.
