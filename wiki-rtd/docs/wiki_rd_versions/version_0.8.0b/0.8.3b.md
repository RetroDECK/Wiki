# RetroDECK 0.8.3b

**Release date:** 2024-07-22


##  RetroDECK Framework / Backend:

**Fixed:**

- A critical issue issue where second level subfolders inside `retrodeck/` folder were not correctly placed and moved to the new file structure under the `retrodeck/ES-DE`. This caused scraped data that was stored under `downloaded_media` and other ES-DE data not to be found.
