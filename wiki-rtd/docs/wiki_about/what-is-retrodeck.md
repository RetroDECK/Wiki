## What is RetroDECK?

RetroDECK is an **All-in-One Retro Gaming Platform** powered by [ES-DE Frontend](https://es-de.org) and available as a [Flatpak](https://flathub.org/apps/net.retrodeck.retrodeck). It includes various pre-configured software like emulators, systems and game engines.

### Easy to Install

You can easily download RetroDECK from Flathub via your software center, such as KDE Discover or Gnome Software.

### Easy to Update

RetroDECK updates through your software center, just like other system updates.

### RetroDECK is contained

By being an all-in-one flatpak application RetroDECK is sandboxed and contained. Thus put all important files from all software in a minimal amount of locations, instead of having them spread out over your entire system. That also makes RetroDECK very easy to remove and clean-up (if you so wish).

### RetroDECK Configurator

The RetroDECK Configurator, accessible from the ES-DE main menu, allows you to change and configure settings across many systems from one interface.

### What is the difference between the main version and the cooker version?
