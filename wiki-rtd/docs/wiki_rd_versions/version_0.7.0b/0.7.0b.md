# RetroDECK v0.7.0b  - Amazing Aozora

<img src="../../../wiki_images/logos/rd-logo-box.png" width="600">

**Release Date:** 2023-06-16

## Read First – Important Changes!

- `PCSX2-SA` latest updates are not compatible with old save states. Please make sure you do an in-game save to your virtual memory card before upgrading.

- The following emulators have changed the defaults and now run the stand-alone version: `Dolphin`, `Citra`, `PPSSPP`. <br>
If you have saves states or just want to go back to the RetroArch version, you can always switch back by pressing: `Other Settings` – `Alternative Emulators` and set them back to the core versions.

- If you decide to install the new `RetroDECK Controller Layout` for the Steam Deck (highly recommended), it will wipe your custom configurations and emulator settings. That’s because all the configs needs to be updated and changed to be compatible. <br>
The choice is yours (you can always install it later via the Configurator if you change your mind).


## New Emulators

- Wii U powered by CEMU

- We had hopes to add MAME standalone as well but we had to push it towards a future update because of various issues. That's why there is a MAME submenu in the new radial menus.



## New General Features

### New - Steam Deck Controller Layout

Please read up on: https://github.com/XargonWan/RetroDECK/wiki/Steam-Deck%3A-Hotkeys-and-controls
- All hotkeys for all emulators have been unified where possible.

This Steam Deck Controller Layout features both

- Radial input menus on the left touchpad.
- Button bound hotkeys you can access by either holding R4 or L4.

**Installation of the layout:**

**From an upgrade:**

A upgrade from a older version to 0.7b you will get a prompt during the upgrade process that asks you if you want to install the layout. If you choose to do this (highly recommended), it will reset your emulators custom configurations if you had them.

**For everyone (upgrade or fresh install):**

After installation need to manually enable the config as under (you also need to do this for a new RetroDECK install): <br>
`Controller Settings` -> `Controller Layouts` -> `Templates` `RetroDECK: Official Layout` with a version number.

**NOTE:**

Not all Emulators has hotkey support; some have partial support, some has none and some has a majority implemented.

**Known issues:**

PPSSPP has an issue with flatpak hotkeys currently on their github so we have mapped ESC `HK + R3` ( press the `Escape` key from the radial menu) to `Open PPSSPP Menu`. In this way you can shutdown, save and access PPSSPP functions from there.
As soon as the issue is solved we will remap everything to the correct hotkeys.
