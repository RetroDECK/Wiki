# ES-DE Frontend - FAQ

## How do I switch language in ES-DE?

ES-DE is by default set to respect your systems language if supported by the frontend. 

If you want to change the locale go to: `UI Settings - Application Language`

## Why can't I press the up button in menus to jump to the bottom row and vice versa?

[Source](https://gitlab.com/es-de/emulationstation-de/-/blob/master/FAQ.md#why-cant-i-press-the-up-button-in-menus-to-jump-to-the-bottom-row-and-vice-versa)

Why this does not work is that menus in ES-DE are not lists but grids.

A grid can not only contain selectable rows with text but also other features like buttons. <br>
For example, in one part of the interface there could just be a list of ROMs but in another there could be various button elements as in the scraping menu.

Enabling the up and down buttons to wrap around would therefore not work consistently as it would sometimes jump to the last row of the grid or to a button at random depending on the layout of the grid.
Every time it would require a different number of button presses depending on the grid layout.

This type of contextual navigation feels very weird in practice, especially when you must press the up button twice to find the underlying cause of a list in some lists but more times in others depending on the button layout.

The solution we opted for instead is:

- `L1` or `Page Up` Jumps up 6 rows in menus and 10 rows in gamelists.
- `R1` or `Page Down` Jumps down 6 rows in menus and 10 rows in gamelists.
- `L2` or `Home` Jumps to the top of the menu or gamelist.
- `R2` or `End` Jumps to the bottom of the menu or gamelist.

## How can I add more themes?

ES-DE comes with a built in Theme Downloader `UI Settings - Theme Downloader`. But you can also add themes manually in the: `~/retrodeck/ES-DE/themes` folder.


## Is there a list of themes?

Yes, check here: [ES-DE: Themes List](https://gitlab.com/es-de/themes/themes-list).



## How do you switch between themes inside of RetroDECK?

You can switch between them by opening the menu and then navigate to `UI Settings - Theme Set` to select the theme you want to use.

## "Why does the theme I am using not work?" or "Why does the layout look broken?" (black screen with blue text)?

- Please make sure you are specifically using a theme that is compatible with [ES-DE](https://www.es-de.org).
- If you are trying to use a theme that was built for Batocera it will not be compatible.
- ES-DE uses a unique theme engine so themes are not directly portable from Batocera.

See the ES-DE's Guide ðŸ“˜ for more details.


## Why does the theme layout look squished?

- The Steam Deck has a screen aspect ratio of `16:10` and most themes that you will find are built for an aspect ratio of `16:9`.  Depending on the theme's design this may cause the layout to appear squished when using it on the Steam Deck's display.

- All the included themes are built for 16:10 aspect ratio so you should not see this issue with any of them; however, if you are downloading a theme from another source there is a chance this can occur for you.

- There are 2 ways to fix this if it does occur: (1) see if a specific version was built for `16:10` aspect ratio and use that instead or (2) edit the theme to make it compatible with that aspect ratio.


## Can I manually add custom game images/videos/media for games that I can not scrape?

Yes, check the file structure over at Emulationstation DE's user guide on gitlab.
