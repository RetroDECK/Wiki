Used for the game LEGO Dimensions

### Steam Input Support
No

### Linux Kernel Support
Yes, it is an NFC reader USB device.

### Udev rule

`SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0e6f", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0241", MODE="0666"`

### Emulator usecase
`RPCS3` `Xenia`

## How to configure

`RPCS3` is the only emulator that supports the ToyPad as of this writing.

### Prerequisite: add the udev rule for the ToyPad

You will need root privileges for this.

Open a Terminal Window and execute  the following command to add the udev rule:

```bash
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0e6f", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0241", MODE="0666"' | sudo tee -a /etc/udev/rules.d/71-toypad.rules > /dev/null
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

It should now work in RetroDECK for Lego Dimensions in the RPCS3 emulator.

### RPCS3 - Lego ToyPad Tips

Before you launch Lego Dimensions from RetroDECK you need to keep the following things in mind:

- The ToyPad must be connected to the USB Port Before launching the game in RetroDECK and RPCS3
- The ToyPad must be connected to a USB Port that gives it enough power to run.

Additional Steam Deck information:

- The Steam Deck's USB-C port does not transmit enough power for the ToyPad, you will need use dock or use a powered USB-C hub.

## Emulated ToyPad (W.I.P)

Berny23's that can use an VM or an Raspberry PI might be an alternative solution.
