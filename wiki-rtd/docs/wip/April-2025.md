## Sibling Controllers Returns

By popular demand RetroDECK is once again opening the vault of the unknown category of controllers: Sibling Controllers.

The RetroDECK Team has been hard at work documenting and tracking down this elusive controller type.

##  AI Powered Gameplay Assist and Voice Reaction  

Many of our users are looking to the past to escape the harsh realities of the modern world. 

But they are missing one key aspect of the retro experience truly authentic. 

We are proud to introduce the next big feature of RetroDECK:

**AI Powered Gameplay Assist and Voice Reaction** 

Connect RetroDECK to your favorite local or cloud native generative AI solutions. 

We have several built-in  character profiles to choose from that will talk to you, assist and comment on your gameplay no matter what the game.

The future is now!

### Character Profiles

Here is a tiny selection of all the characters we will offer. 

#### Raid Leader

The Raid Leader will do quick passive aggressive comments and remarks about your gameplay because you are not playing it perfectly. But in truth you can never be perfect and thus you are in for a constant torrent of remarks / comments and the feeling of being constantly degraded (just like a real Raid Leader).


**When you are playing:** 

- The Raid Leader will constantly remind you that you are playing at below-shit-tier-level no matter what you play or how you play.
- The Raid Leader will inform you the only way you can be better is you quit your job / class / family / friends and dedicate you entire life to the game.
- Each time you do the slightest misstep the Raid Leader will go into *rage mode*, cussing at you and will reduce your DKP by at least 50 points (that is a lot of points).

#### Drunk Hunter

The Drunk Hunter only communicates in semi drunken grunts, hisses, random words, sounds of pouring glasses, opening cans and keyboard noises. The drunken hunter will assist your gameplay like a auto player or aimbot, playing at your game at a scaling level. 

**When you are playing:** 


- **Level 1**: The assist starts slow at first playing at an average level until about 1.30 hours in. You will hear the sounds of cans opening and glasses being poured.

- **Level 2**: Between 1.31 hours to 2.30 hours, you will have perfect gameplay with the with the sound of him rolling his head all over the the keyboard back and forth for maximum gameplay DPS.

- **Level 3**: Post the 2.31 hours mark, the AI assist will collapse and keep failing the slightest tasks accompanied by: 

    - The sounds of random drunk noises.
    - Drunk mentioning of something called Aimed Shot.
    - The sounds dropping things on the floor and broken glass.



#### Bigger Sibling

The Bigger Sibling will join you in multiplayer games as the second player.

**When you are playing:** 

The Bigger Sibling operates under special guidelines. 

**If you are playing a PVP game:**

- The bigger sibling will always pick the most cheesy and broken character. 
- If the most cheesy and broken character is taken by you, he/she will call your parents.


**If you are playing a CO-OP game:**

- The bigger sibling will always pick the most cheesy and broken character if there is one. 
- If there is some cooperative puzzle like grabbing you and taking your over an edge, the sibling will always drop you two to five times first on purse with an annoying laughter.
- If you are in a obstacle course and needs to jump over pits, the bigger sibling will auto adapt and try to block your path so you fall into the pit in about 50% of the time.
    - If you are blocking your sibling and pushing him/her into pits, he/she will call your parents.

**What happens if the parents are called?**
    
- If the parents are called, they will ask you both to go to your room and RetroDECK will shutdown automatically and abruptly, all progress will be lost.

#### COD 360 Lobby Gamer

The COD 360 Lobby Gamer brings you all the best experiences from early online console gaming.

**When you are playing:** 

The COD 360 Lobby Gamer 

- Will spend most of the time screaming loudly.
- Suck at games.
- When confronted will be talking about all the depraved things he will do to your mom.

#### The Ghost of Mourning

The Ghost of Mourning offers sudden whispers of ghostly haunting greeting phrases not related to your gameplay before going silent again. 

This AI character simulates the feeling of the dread, loss and loneliness of the player that still is always looking and yearning endlessly in vein for his long dead guild/clan/group/team have ceased to exist over a more then a decade ago.

Every day the ghost:

- Keeps logging in everyday to the game itself.
- Keeps logging in everyday to the old empty communication server (Ventrilo, TeamSpeak, Mumble, etc..).

Stuck in forever in a endless perpetual login torment.

**When you are playing:** 

As you are playing, in certain days you will see hear an simulated social login sound and have different people make ghostly whispers to you:

- "Hey, are you playing?!" 
- "Hey, long time no see" 
- "Wow this place is totally empty"
- "Good to you again!"
- "I got purples / diamonds / kill streak last night!"
- "Do you remember when we did this the raid / tournament / build / match together, those where the days"

Before you can even say a word back... the disconnect sound is played and it is once again silent for days.

##### The Trauma Center

As The Ghost of Mourning is the most traumatizing of all characters. 

The RetroDECK Team have created a üè•-trauma-center channel on the Discord that will be populated by a vast network community none-experts for it to be a place where people can talk about their long lost Guild/Clan/Group/Team. 

**One user**: I still see her everytime I login right there in my friends list on Steam. Been offline for 13 years, my brain tells me... I need to remove this dead account. But everytime I move the cursor I just can't... I need that avatar still in my life. "PEELSSSSS HERE FOREVER OMEGAKILLER9999".

**Another**: We where building blocks, I was making a train station and TheDuckMan0910 was making a stupid statue in the middle of the road, blocking everything in sight and polluting the landscape, like an eyesore. But the TheDuckMan0910 never returned after the last nightly logout. His stupid statue still stands in the middle of the landscape never to be touched but as a monument to all the diamonds we got in the end. I miss that stupid man of a duck...

**Another One**: WHERE THE BOYS AT?!...Where the boys?... Boys?... :(
