# RetroDECK 0.8.3b

**Release date:** 2024-07-30

##  RetroDECK Framework / Backend:

**Fixed:**

- An issue where second level subfolders inside `retrodeck/` folder were not correctly placed and moved to the new folder structure under the `retrodeck/ES-DE`. This caused scraped data that was stored under `downloaded_media` and other ES-DE data not to be found by the ES-DE frontend.
- An issue with folder creation during initial setup that would create duplicate subfolders in some scenarios.

## Ryujinx:

- We have reverted Ryujinx to the last known working version after some testing done by the RetroDECK Team and the RetroDECK Community.

### Notice - Ryujinx Symlink Issue:

The reported issue about Ryujinx not working as well as it should with Linux symlinks still exists, please read more in the [Known Issues](../../wiki_bugs/known-issues.md) page. The RetroDECK Team is working with parts of the Ryujinx Team for a permanent fix with newer versions and hope to have more to share in the future.
