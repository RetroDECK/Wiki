# May 2024: Progress report

Highlights:

- Godot Configurator Work
- Primehack special thanks

<!-- more -->

## Godot Configurator Status

We are working slow and steady on the replacement Godot version of the Configurator.

- This is still early and not everything works (but we are getting there!).
- The long term goal is to expose more emulator settings directly in the Configurator and reduce the need to go into each emulators interface.
- The new interface can be fully navigated with the controller.

## Primehack special thanks

Two developers on Github by the names of TheDrifter and Xiota have done an very good job on separating and re-branding the Primehacks internal structure on Linux from Dolphin to make them not be in conflict.

TheDrifter maintained his own fork before soon merging it into Primehack proper with these changes for a long time. RetroDECK always used this fork because it would otherwise conflict with Dolphin (as we ship both inside one application).

Us in the RetroDECK Team have always communicated with them and supported them on in their efforts and we are happy that their changes are hopefully soon in mainline Primehack.


## That is all for now

Thanks everyone!
