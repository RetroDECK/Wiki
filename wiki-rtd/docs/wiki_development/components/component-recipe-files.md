# Components Recipe Files

The "Recipe" files purpose is to tell the RetroDECK build automation system what needs to happen to take the components base source (AppImage, Flatpak, Binary, etc...) and turn it into a RetroDECK Component.

The recipe files is are included in the final component package. 

## The four Components Recipe Files

- **component_manifest.json** - JSON file containing general information about the component, preset and menu compatibility, preset action information, core information (as applicable).

- **component_functions.sh** - A Bash file containing config file paths (the kind previously found in the global.sh library) and defined functions relating to the component. If the component has a function that is specific to it, such as installing firmware or advanced functions found in the Configurator menus, they should be here.

- **component_prepare.sh** - A Bash file containing the segment of code formerly found in the prepare_component.sh core library. The structure is identical, and the code is used for performing actions on the component like resets and folder moves.

- **component_launcher.sh** - A Bash file acting as a launcher wrapper for the component. Settings will include changing environmental variables etc. or whatever else is needed to launch the component in the sub-sandbox setup.

## component_component_manifest.json

The `component_manifest.json` file contains both "informational" contents, values that will be used in Configurator menus or API code to find the capabilities of the component: what system is runs, it's features, what presets it is compatible with etc.



### component_manifest.json structure

The basic structure of the `component_manifest.json` file is

```

{
  "component_name": {
    "name": "Component Name",
      "description": "A human-friendly description of the component to be shown in menus",
      "url": "<link to the pcomponents RetroDECK wiki entry>",

            "defaults_file": "$component_defaults_file1"
          }
        }
      }
    },

        "name": "Menu-friendly core name",
        "description": "Core description",
        "system": [ "emulated system1", "emulated_system2" ]
      }
    }
  }
}

```

### component_name

**component_name** - This is the internal name for this component as used in the Framework. This name must also match the component folder name. From the current path for these files listed above, this means this manifest file would be found at /app/retrodeck/components/component_name/component_manifest.json

- **name** - A human-friendly name for this component, as shown in menu dialogs

- **description** - A human-friendly description for this component, as shown in menu dialogs

- **url** - A link to the RetroDECK wiki entry for this component, or elsewhere if a wiki entry doesn't exist

- **system** - A single value or array of values of machine-friendly names of the systems emulated by this component

### configurator_menus

**configurator_menus** - This is an optional section for components that should have component-specific settings in a given Configurator menu. This does not affect the visibility of presets, but is more used for one-off actions specific to that component (such as installing RPCS3 firmware, Showing/Hiding Portmaster or any of the internal RetroDECK tools like BIOS checking or folder moving.

- **<menu_name>** - This section is the name of the menu "class" the menu entry applies to. This will be used for dynamically generating menu entries, so if a menu is looking for "settings" menu entries, in this example only the "portmaster" menu entry would be used.

- **<entry_name>** - This is an arbitrary name to identify the menu entry for search. It is not currently used internally for anything except identification. As with all JSON keys, it must be uniquely named in its parent object.

- **name** - A human-friendly name of the menu entry, as shown in menu dialogs

- **description** - A human-friendly description of the menu entry, as shown in menu dialogs

- **command** - The command that will be run when the menu entry is selected. This can be a single line command if it is a simple action, or an internally defined function (with optional arguments) for more complex actions. Any component-specific function referenced here should be defined in that components component_functions.sh file.

### compatible_presets

- **compatible_presets** - A list of objects with the key being the preset name (as found in retrodeck.cfg) and the possible values for this preset for this component. In the array of values, the first value MUST always be the "disabled" state. The state name is arbitrary, but the first value is what is referenced by the Framework as the "disabled" state and all others are some form of "enabled". These entries are also what are referenced when adding new components to the retrodeck.cfg file on update. As new components are added, this section will be checked and any component that supports a given preset but an entry does not yet exist for it in retrodeck.cfg will be added at update time, so the supported presets lists no longer need to be shipped statically in retrodeck.cfg, all the components that exist and support any preset will have their entries maintained in retrodeck.cfg automatically.

- **preset_actions** - This is a section containing the actions that should be taken to enable / disable any given preset this component supports (these are replacing the information found the individual preset reference lists in pre-0.10.0b). If the component does not support any presets, this section can be omitted completely. 

- **config_file_format** - The format used by functions like set_setting_value for enacting this preset

- **preset_name** - The name of the preset, matching the entries in "compatible_presets" that the containing actions should be used for. Alternatively, this can be the name of a component core, if applicable. The rest of the action object will then go inside that core object. If this is a core preset action, the "config_file_format" will also go inside it.

- **setting_name** - The name of the setting being changed. This would be the actual line name used in the component config file being edited for this preset.

The objects in this section will have the following structure, taken from the legacy preset reference lists:


```
action
new_setting_value
section
target_file
defaults_file
```


These entries can contain variable names (such as sourced config file paths) or be omitted entirely if not needed, such as if the target file does not use sections the "section" line can be left out, or just left empty.


### cores

**cores** - If the component has sub-components (such as RetroArch cores) which need their own information for use in menus etc., they will be stored here. Each object in the "cores" section will have the following structure:

- **component_core_name** - A unique name that will show up for preset settings in retrodeck.cfg etc.

- **name** - A human friendly name for this core, as shown in menus

- **description** - A human-friendly description of this core, as shown in menus

- **system** - A single value or array of values of machine-friendly names of the systems emulated by this core.

- **system_friendly_name** - A human-friendly name of the system(s) emulated by this core, as shown in menus.

### Example: component_manifest.json for internal component RetroDECK

Even an Internal Component like RetroDECK will also have `component_manifest.json`.

Which contain any related information used in menus or API data gathering. As most internal components won't support things like presets, they will generally be shorter than actual emulator components.

    }
  }
}

## component_functions.sh

This file will contain the component-specific path variables as well as any component-specific function definitions needed. 

The component path variables are what would have been found in the legacy global.sh file. This way we don't need to maintain a massive monolithic global.sh file as new components are added. 

Every component_functions.sh file will be iteratively sourced on boot, so all the paths and defined functions will always be available and don't need to be maintained in any list as new components are added.

### Example: component_functions.sh PPSSPP

Here is an example of a `specific component_functions.sh` file for the PPSSPP component:

```
#!/bin/bash
ppssppconf="$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ppsspp/PSP/SYSTEM/ppsspp.ini"
ppssppcontrolsconf="$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ppsspp/PSP/SYSTEM/controls.ini"
ppssppcheevosconf="$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ppsspp/PSP/SYSTEM/ppsspp_retroachievements.dat"
ppsspp_test_function() {
  log d "PPSSPP function test confirmed! contents: $1"
}
```

---

## component_prepare.sh

This file will contain the contents of the section of the legacy prepare_component library that apply to only this component. This way all prepare_component actions are broken out on a per-component basis, and we won't have a massive monolithic file to maintain as new components are added. 

The structure of each file is the same as was used before, to maintain the "reset a specific component, or all components" functionality. 

The internal code process is that whenever the "prepare_component" function is called, every installed components file will be sourced, so each file will decide if it needs to trigger or not.

### Example: component_prepare.sh PPSSPP

```

#!/bin/bash
if [[ "$component" =~ ^(ppsspp|all)$ ]]; then
  component_found="true"
  if [[ "$action" == "reset" ]]; then # Run reset-only commands
    log i "------------------------"
    log i "Preparing PPSSPPSDL"
    log i "------------------------"
    if [[ $multi_user_mode == "true" ]]; then # Multi-user actions
      create_dir -d "$multi_user_data_folder/$SteamAppUser/config/ppsspp/PSP/SYSTEM/"
      cp -fv "$config/ppssppsdl/"* "$multi_user_data_folder/$SteamAppUser/config/ppsspp/PSP/SYSTEM/"
      set_setting_value "$multi_user_data_folder/$SteamAppUser/config/ppsspp/PSP/SYSTEM/ppsspp.ini" "CurrentDirectory" "$roms_folder/psp" "ppsspp" "General"
      dir_prep "$multi_user_data_folder/$SteamAppUser/config/ppsspp" "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ppsspp"
    else # Single-user actions

      backup_file="$backups_folder/cheats/PPSSPP-$(date +%y%m%d).tar.gz"
      create_dir "$(dirname "$backup_file")"
      tar -czf "$backup_file" -C "$cheats_folder" PPSSPP
      log i "PPSSPP cheats backed up to $backup_file"

    set_setting_value "$ppssppconf" "CurrentDirectory" "$roms_folder/psp" "ppsspp" "General"

    dir_prep "$cheats_folder/PPSSPP" "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ppsspp/PSP/Cheats"
  fi
fi

```

## component_launcher.sh

This file will contain the specific code needed to launch a component in its sub-sandbox. The contents will vary depending on the needs of the component and where it may be looking for its own packaged information.

As binaries are no longer being packaged into `/app/bin`, this file is also what is called when the given component should be launched, either by ES-DE or a Configurator / CLI argument. 

When launching any component, it will be done by `/app/retrodeck/components/<component name>/component_launcher.sh`

### Example: component_launcher.sh PPSSPP

```
#!/bin/bash
RD_MODULES="/app/retrodeck/components"
LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$RD_MODULES/ppsspp/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"
exec "$RD_MODULES/ppsspp/bin/PPSSPPSDL" "$@"
```
