Got that one friend everyone secretly dislikes but has to invite because your mom said so? Hand them the HyperMax 3!

Even if you protested, your mom sternly reminded you to invite everyone to play games, even the annoying ones (thanks mom!).

So, as petty revenge, you handed that "friend" this controller. 

Good luck, Brad!

### Samurai PS2

Give them the Samurai PS2! It's the most uncomfortable controller you could find.

## Super Nintendo

Your sibling told your dad you took the last Mars bar, but it was actually them.

### The Super Pad

You need to win this Ready 2 Rumble Boxing match against your sibling.

## GameCube

GameCube had its fair share of sibling controllers, but none more legendary than...

### MadCatz GameCube

<img src= "../madcatz-gc.png" width="200">


This legendary controller has caused several family tragedies over the years. 

You had your game plan set and only allowed your little sibling to use this awful, broken controller while you played Smash.

Everything was going well until one day, years later, your mom got a second official GameCube controller for your sibling. 

You realized in horror the monster you had created. Like Goku training with weighted clothes, your sibling quickly decimated you in Smash with their ungodly skills using an official controller and rose to fame in the Smash community, beating everyone in local tournaments.

Now, 20+ years later, you sit with chronic back pain, arthritis, and resentment, pondering those days when you beat your sibling in Smash. 

You no longer speak to your sibling except for the mandatory yearly BBQ your father desperately hosts to keep the family together. 

Every time your sibling pulls up in your father's driveway with their new car filled with Smash trophies and victory money, all you can do is communicate with grunts and pain.

## The Ultimate Sibling Controller

There exists one controller that has reigned supreme across several console generations. It still holds the throne as the ultimate sibling controller, and nothing can come close to claiming its title.

### Fisher Price: Laugh & Learn - Game Controller

<img src= "../fisher-price-laugh-and-learn.png" width="200">

Of all the controllers on this list, none gives you as much power and joy as the Fisher Price: Laugh & Learn - Game Controller. 

This controller is designed by the top engineers at Fisher Price to be the ultimate sibling controller.

Can you believe the audacity?!

They designed the entire product around the premise of playing pranks and tricking your younger siblings into thinking they are “good gamers” and "gaming" with big brother/sister.

It is the ultimate sibling con, and nothing can ever top its place as the number one sibling controller of all time.

"**Little Sis/Bro:** I am the best at this game!"

"**You:** Sure...sure... little sis/bro, you are the best at this game! (You are not even playing, MUHAHAHAHAHA!!!)"
