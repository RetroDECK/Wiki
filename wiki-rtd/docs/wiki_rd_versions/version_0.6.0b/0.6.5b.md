**Release Date:** 2023-04-07

### Information:

Just a quick hotfix for Yuzu (since some games where not working in 0.6.4b). We had to roll back to the latest working version.
Newer versions will be shipped with v0.7.0b.

## Bug fixes and other changes:

- Rolled back to latest working Yuzu as some games had issues with the latest update.
- Slightly improved Yuzu performance by tweaking GPU options
- Fixed an issue where the default theme was not loaded
- Removed unavailable emulators entries
