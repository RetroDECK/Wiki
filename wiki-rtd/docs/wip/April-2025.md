## NEW - AI Powered Game Play Assist and Voice Simulation  

Many of our users are looking to the past to escape the harsh realities of the modern world. 

But they are missing one key aspect of the retro experience truly authentic. 

We are proud to introduce the next big feature of RetroDECK:

**AI Powered Game Play Assist and Voice Simulation** 

Connect RetroDECK to your favorite local or cloud native generative AI solutions. Have several character profiles to choose from that will talk to you, assist and comment on your gameplay no matter what the game.

### Character Profiles

#### World of Warcraft - Raid Leader

The Raid Leader will do quick comments and remarks that you can only get better no matter what to do. 

**When you are playing:** He will constantly remind you that you are playing at below-shit-tier-level and each time you do the slightest misstep he will go into rage mode and reduce your DKP by at least 50. 

#### World of Warcraft - Drunk Hunter

The Drunk Hunter only communicates in semi drunken grunts, hisses, random words, sounds of pouring glasses, opening cans and keyboard noises. 

**When you are playing:** The drunken hunter will assist your gameplay, playing at scaling level. 

- **Level 1**: The assist starts slow at first playing at an average level until about 1.30 hours in. You will hear the sounds of cans opening and glasses being poured.

- **Level 2**: Between 1.31 hours to 2.30 hours, you will have perfect gameplay with the with the sound of him rolling his head all over the the keyboard back and forth for maximum gameplay DPS.

- **Level 3**: Post the 2.31 hours mark, the AI assist will collapse and keep failing with the sounds of random drunk noises and dropping things on the floor.

#### World of Warcraft - Depression Guild

#### Bigger Sibling

#### Xbox 360: Xbox Live - COD Lobby Gamer

#### Steam - The Lost Gamer


#### PlayStation 3: PSN - Connection Chaos
