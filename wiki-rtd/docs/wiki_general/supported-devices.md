RetroDECK works on Linux desktops but relies on Steam Input for advanced hotkeys. For the best experience, use a distribution with built-in Game Mode like SteamOS, Bazzite, or ChimeraOS and more.


## Other x86_64 Linux Handhelds / Devices

Our community is highly creative and likes putting RetroDECK on new devices.

RetroDECK can work on various devices emulating PlayStation, Steam Deck, or Xbox controllers in Steam Input. If a device has custom inputs, contact the RetroDECK Team to help us create a Steam Input profile.
