## Information

RetroDECK relies on its dependencies to function. Without them, RetroDECK and similar projects cannot exist. We aim to collaborate with other projects to improve RetroDECK and Linux as a whole.

If you prefer to donate to the frontend, art assets, a specific emulator, or engine instead of RetroDECK, we support your choice. The goal of RetroDECK is not to make a big profit but to pursue a passion project.

If you feel passionate about a specific emulator/engine/other, always donate to them directly and not via proxy. No project should control another project's funds.

We list current and future software and functions we want to include in RetroDECK and their licenses. More items will be added in upcoming updates.

There are many emulators, software, front-ends, and assets not part of RetroDECK. This is not a complete list of all emulators or frontends on the internet.

## RetroDECK

<img src="../../wiki_icons/retrodeck/icon-rd.svg" width="75">

By donating to RetroDECK, you support the project and the vision of a unified experience.

### We will use those funds to:


- Pay for web hosting, build servers, and other hosting costs.
- Pay for development software and licenses (we strive to use FOSS and CC licenses as much as possible).
- Pay for UI elements and art from artists (we strive to use FOSS and CC licenses as much as possible).

On rare occasions, the RetroDECK Team might need to buy new devices and hardware for RetroDECK development (we will inform the community before doing so):

- Gaming devices like the Steam Deck or Rog Ally.
- Various big brand and small brand controllers for development.
- Special peripherals: Lightguns, Wheels, XAC, Vboard, etc.
