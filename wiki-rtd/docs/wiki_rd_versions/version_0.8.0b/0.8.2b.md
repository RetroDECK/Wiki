# RetroDECK 0.8.2b

**Release date:** 2024-06-XX

## Updates

Everything was updated to their latest version where possible.

- Emulators
- ES-DE
- Engines
- RetroArch: Stable Cores and Nightly Cores
- Freedesktop KDE QT to 6.7


## RetroDECK Configurator

**Added:**

- A new `Empty ROMs folder removal` tool. This tools cleans up empty roms folder from `retrodeck/roms`. It's for those users that don't want to have a bunch of empty folders populating the roms folder to keep it slim and clean.
- A new `Rebuild removed ROMs folders` tool. It's for those users that did not want to have a bunch of empty folders populating the roms folder and ran the `Empty ROMs folder removal` tool. But then realized they still wanted them and regretted their decision or for those that accidentally deleted folders (you know who you are).


**Fixed:**

- A problem with `.chd` compression that was introduced in 0.8.1b.
- A problem with multi-file compression tool that prevented some file types to be properly converted that was introduced in 0.8.1b.


## CEMU


**Added:**

- Added microphone blow input to R3 (this only works is some games).


**Fixed:**

- A problem with audio output on when docking and undocking.


##  RetroDECK Framework / Backend:

**Added:**

- Enabled a self-hosted Gitea repo for disaster recovery.
- Added headless states for some functions (this will help to migrate to the Godot Configurator)
