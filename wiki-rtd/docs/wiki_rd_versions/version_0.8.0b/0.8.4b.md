# RetroDECK 0.8.4b

**Release date:** 2024-08-XX

##  RetroDECK Framework / Backend:

**Fixed:**

- An issue where the fix for: second level subfolders inside `retrodeck/` folder were not correctly placed and moved to the new folder structure under the `retrodeck/ES-DE`. This caused scraped data that was stored under `downloaded_media` and other ES-DE data not to be found by the ES-DE frontend. In 0.8.3b was not fully triggering for some users.
