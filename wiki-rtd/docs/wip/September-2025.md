<!-- more -->


## ImCoKeMaN & PortMaster Team - Added more ports

<img src="../portmaster-logo.png" width="75"> 

Community member ImCoKeMaN have helped the PortMaster Team getting more X86_64 ports available and thus they are in RetroDECK.

So far about 30 new ports have been added.

We give ImCoKeMaN and the PortMaster Team our biggest thanks. 

## RetroDECK 0.10.0b - Status

<img src="../icon-rd.svg" width="75"> 

RetroDECK‚ÄØ0.10.0b is advancing under the ‚ÄúProject‚ÄØNeo‚Äù umbrella, that we first talked about in June.

We‚Äôre still addressing component‚Äëspecific issues, so the final release will take additional time and no ETAs. We‚Äôre rebuilding large portions of the application and its build pipeline from the ground up‚Äîmaking this effort feel more like **RetroDECK‚ÄØII** or **RetroDECK‚ÄØNeo**, which explains the project name.

We are doing a mix of:

- **Adding new and old components** to the new architecture and make them run. <- We are focused here currently.
- **Updating configuration files** for each component to align with the new structure. 
- **Adapt all** Configurator Tools and functions. 
- Conduct extensive **testing and bug‚Äëfixing**.
- **Writing documentation** for the wiki.

We‚Äôre also integrating numerous new components, with the update‚Äôs focus centered on these enhancements.

## Anything Else You Are Working On?

### Storage folder
We are planning a new core‚Äësystem folder under **retrodeck/** called **storage**. This folder will house several types of user added data:

- **DLC / Updates** - For the components that have that.
- **Plugins** - Plugin folders that are not game mods.
- **Specific Assets** - Some components like MAME have several folders that can be put here like: GameOver screens and more.   
- **Workable Writable Space** - Temporary or persistent writable areas (e.g., for the DOSBox‚ÄëX sandbox).  

> **RetroDECK Team Note:** This probably will not might not make it into 0.10.0b. The exact structure of the folder will evolve as we gather feedback and identify further use‚Äëcases. 

### Lahrs folder Icons

The goal is that we in **RetroDeck‚ÄØ0.10.0b** ship Lahrs custom folder icons for every RetroDeck folder. 

They will be enabled by default and the new icons should appear automatically after the update. 

There are plans to make a Configurator Tool to turn them on or off. 

We thank Lahrs for his tremendous effort creating specific icons for each folder.
