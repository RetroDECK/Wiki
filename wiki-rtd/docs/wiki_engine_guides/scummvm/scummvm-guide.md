### Where to put the games?
ScummVM games should be put into the `retrodeck/roms/scummvm/` directory.<br>

### Does ScummVM require BIOS or Firmware?
No

## How to: Get games to show up inside the ES-DE interface

**Example:** <br>
In this example we got a game we want to add: `Beneath a Steel Sky`

### Step 1: Add the game

Move the uncompressed game into the `retrodeck/roms/scummvm/` folder.<br>
The result should be: `retrodeck/roms/scummvm/Beneath a Steel Sky/`

### Step 2: Check the ScummVM ID of the game

Go into [ScummVM Game Compatibility and ID List](https://www.scummvm.org/compatibility)<br>
Search for `Beneath a Steel Sky` make a note of the ScummVM ID in this case called: `sky`

### Step 3: Create the .scummvm file
- The `.scummvm` file starts as a empty textfile that needs to be created in each game you want to adds directory.
- It should be named `<ScummVM_ID>.scummvm`
- In our example the file will be called `sky.scummvm` and should be created in `retrodeck/roms/scummvm/Beneath a Steel Sky/`

The end result should look like:<br>
`retrodeck/roms/scummvm/Beneath a Steel Sky/sky.scummvm`

### Step 4: Open the .scummvm file and add the ScummVM_ID
Open up the empty `sky.scummvm` file and just type in the `<ScummVM_ID>` in the first row of the file and save in this example `sky`. Make sure you don't add any spaces or linebreaks and the file should just contain the word `sky`.

### Step 5: The game should now run
The game should now be added to the ES-DE interface from the `retrodeck/roms/scummvm/Beneath a Steel Sky/sky.scummvm` file you just created and can be played after you reload RetroDECK from the Configurator or re-launch the application.
