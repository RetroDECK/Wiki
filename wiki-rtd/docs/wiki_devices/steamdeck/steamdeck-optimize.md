## Increasing VRAM to 4 GB

Adjusting the VRAM allocation to 4 GB through the BIOS can improve performance in certain components by providing additional memory to the integrated GPU.

**Installation Steps**

1. Power off your Steam Deck completely.  
2. Press and hold the **Power Button** and **Volume Up Button** simultaneously until you hear a chime/beep, then release both buttons.  
3. In the boot menu, select **Setup Utility**.  
4. Navigate to the **Advanced** tab.  
5. Locate the **UMA Frame Buffer Size** setting and change it to **4 GB**.  
6. Save your changes and exit the BIOS.

Your Steam Deck will now boot with the updated VRAM allocation.

2. Open **Konsole** or another terminal application.  
3. Enter the command: `passwd` 
4. You will now set your new sudo password.
