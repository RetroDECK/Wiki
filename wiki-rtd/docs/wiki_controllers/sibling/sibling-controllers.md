# Sibling Controllers

Sibling Controllers is a broad category that encompasses the some parts of the third party controller space. <br>
They are often controllers that are unconformable to hold, break easy or just look weird.<br>
So you passive aggressively hand them over to your sibling or friend to make sure you win all the games.



## PlayStation 2

The PS2 had a vast selection of sibling controllers

Famous for being the mold example of what a sibling controller is. Breaks easily, is extremely unconformable and will increase your chances of winning by 50%.

This is a trap style controller to stop your sibling from ruining all the important buttons on other controllers. As your sibling likes to press all the buttons all the time, this is the perfect options as there is so many options to press so he/she can't break them all?... Right?!

### Nyko Airflow 2

This is the perfect controller for that friend that just can't stop talking when you play. The extremely loud fan will dampen out any vocal annoyances and allow you to concentrate on winning Tekken Tag Tournament.

### HyperMax 3

This is the controller for the one person that everyone in the friend group hated except for your best friend. Because this person was his/her friend and a major annoyance to your perfect friendship dynamic. When you told your mom you did not want to invite him/her you got sternly yelled at and  you need to invite everyone to play even the toxic people. So as petty revenge you gave Brad?? this controller... good luck... Brad!


### Samurai PS2

One of your friends is extremely good at games and no matter what controller you throw at him/her...you loose. So you gave him/her the most unconformable controller you could find... the Samurai. If that friend still won you moved on to the one of your ultimate weapons.

### Resident Evil 4 - Chainsaw

So you just lost to your friend again on using the Samurai PS2 controller, this time you will not loose... you gave him/her this the scion of ultimate uncomfortablility for the PS2. The Resident Evil 4 Chainsaw controller:

- It is big
- It is bulky
- It is unwieldy

This time you will win for sure!

## Super Nintendo

### Ascii Pad SNES

The Ascii Pad SNES is a bit unconformable but your sibling that was struggling in CO-OP games for the SNES needed a bit of a turbo boost... you would never use the this kind of turbo controller against your sibling right? To spam in Street Fighter 2??? RIGHT?!

## GameCube

GameCube had it's fare share of controller but no one more legendary then

### MadCatz GameCube

<img src= "../madcatz-gc.png" width="200">

This legendary controller has caused several family tragedies over the years. There you where, with your gameplan set and you only allowed your little sibling this awful and broken piece of controller while your where playing Smash. Everything was going well until that one day some years later your mom got you a second real GameCube controller for your sibling to use. You realized in horror of the beast you had unleshed, like Goku from Dragonball caring rocks on his backs for years... you had created a monster. Your sibling decimated you in Smash with his/her ungodly skills with a real controller and quickly rose to fame in the Smash community beating everyone in local tournaments.

Now you sit here 15 years later with chronic back pain, arthritis and resentment of what you have created, pondering of those days of yore when you beat your sibling in Smash. You no longer speak to your sibling except for the mandatory yearly BBQ your father desperately host to keep the family together. Every time your sibling pulls up the in your fathers driveway with his/her new car filled to the brim with Smash trophies and victory money... all you can do is communicate with grunts.


## The Ultimate Sibling Controller

Of all controllers on the market there is only one that raging supreme and have stood victorious for several console generations. It still holds the throne to this day as the ultimate sibling controller.

### Fisher Price: Laugh & Learn - Game Controller

<img src= "../fisher-price-laugh-and-learn.png" width="200">

Of all the controllers on this list no one gives you as the sibling more joy then tricking your younger sibling that he/she is playing with you, thinging they are the kings / queens of gaming... when in fact they are not. It is the ultimate sibling con and nothing can ever top it's place as the number 1 sibling controller of all time.

"Sure...sure... little brother / sister look how good you are in this game... (You are not even playing MUHAHAHAHAHA)"
