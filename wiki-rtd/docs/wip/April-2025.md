##  AI Powered Game Play Assist and Voice Simulation  

Many of our users are looking to the past to escape the harsh realities of the modern world. 

But they are missing one key aspect of the retro experience truly authentic. 

We are proud to introduce the next big feature of RetroDECK:

**AI Powered Game Play Assist and Voice Simulation** 

Connect RetroDECK to your favorite local or cloud native generative AI solutions. Have several character profiles to choose from that will talk to you, assist and comment on your gameplay no matter what the game.

### Character Profiles

#### Raid Leader

The Raid Leader will do quick comments and remarks that you can only get better no matter what to do. 

**When you are playing:** 

He will constantly remind you that you are playing at below-shit-tier-level and each time you do the slightest misstep he will go into rage mode and reduce your DKP by at least 50. 

#### Drunk Hunter

The Drunk Hunter only communicates in semi drunken grunts, hisses, random words, sounds of pouring glasses, opening cans and keyboard noises. 

**When you are playing:** The drunken hunter will assist your gameplay, playing at your game at an scaling level. 

- **Level 1**: The assist starts slow at first playing at an average level until about 1.30 hours in. You will hear the sounds of cans opening and glasses being poured.

- **Level 2**: Between 1.31 hours to 2.30 hours, you will have perfect gameplay with the with the sound of him rolling his head all over the the keyboard back and forth for maximum gameplay DPS.

- **Level 3**: Post the 2.31 hours mark, the AI assist will collapse and keep failing with the sounds of random drunk noises and dropping things on the floor.

#### Depression Guild / Clan

The Depression Guild / Clan offers sudden whispers of ghostly haunting greeting phrases not related to your gameplay before going silent. 

This AI simulates the feeling of the player that still to this day keeps logging in to the empty old TeamSpeak server and the game itself everyday. 

Always looking endlessly for his guild/clain that ceased to exist over a more then a decade ago.

**When you are playing:** As you are playing, in certain days you will see hear an simulated social login sound and have different people make ghostly whispers to you:

- "Hey, are you playing?!" 
- "Hey, long time no see" 
- "Wow this place is totally empty"
- "Do you remember when we did this the raid / tournament together, those where the days"

Before you can even say a word back, the disconnect sound is played and it is once again silent for days.


#### Bigger Sibling

The Bigger Sibling will join you in multiplayer as the second player.

**When you are playing:** 

The Bigger Sibling operates under special guidelines. 

**If you are playing a PVP game:**

- The bigger sibling will always pick the most cheesy and broken character. 
- If the most cheesy and broken character is taken, he/she will call your parents.


**If you are playing a CO-OP game:**

- The bigger sibling will always pick the most cheesy and broken character if there is one. 
- If there is some cooperative puzzle like grabbing you and taking your over an edge, the sibling will always drop you two to five times first on purpse with an annoying laughter.
- If you are in a obstacle course and needs to jump over pits, the bigger sibling will auto adapt and try to block your path so you fall into the pit in about 50% of the time.
    - If you are blocking your sibling and pushing him/her into pits, he/she will call your parents.

**If parents are called:**
    
- If the parents are called, they will ask you both to go to your room and RetroDECK will shutdown automatically and abruptly, all progress will be lost.
